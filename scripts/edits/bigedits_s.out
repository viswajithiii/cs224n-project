u'\nTime to Stretch Goals!\nWe\'re funded !! Thank you very much for all your support. Now it is time to stretch goals.Ambient Light Sensor\xa0- \xa345,000(Almost Reached!)\xa0We\'ll add an ambient light sensor in the controller circuit.The sensor will measure the light conditions in the room and change the LED strip light level automatically. It will be optional mode in the driver software.Ambient Light + Color Sensor\xa0-\xa0\xa360,000\xa0We\'ll add a RGB color sensor in the controller circuit. This sensor can measure the full visible spectrum light levels and helps you to calibrate your monitor or correct the LED strip colors under colored room lights.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\xa0What is AmbliLED HD?\xa0 \xa0AmbiLED HD is the first high resolution ambient light conversation kit for computer monitors.We started out designing it as just an open source fun project, but after our prototype generated a large amount of interest,we have decided to offer this as a commercial product.\xa0\xa0 Common commercial and DIY ambient light systems use 3-30 LEDs around the display. This is because every individual RGB LED requires 3 pins to control the colours. This means a lot of cables and connectors between LEDs and controller.\xa0\n\n\n\xa0 Thanks to new generation individually addressable WS2812B 16 million colours RGB LEDs, there is no longer a need for complex cabling and connections. Here is the back of our test monitor that you can see on the Kickstarter video. We applied a 290cm long strip with 172 LEDs. There is no cabling or construction behind the monitor.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\xa0      AmbiLED HD can control up to 512 LEDs(8.5 meters) with just a 3 pin connection, and works as a single self-adhesive LED strip without any extra cabling. Just attach the strip to the back of your display, plug the 3 pin connector into the AmbiLED HD controller, supply the controller with AC adapter (included) and connect it to USB port of your PC.That\'s all you need to enjoy AmbiLED HD.\n\n\n\n\nHow does it work?\xa0 The human eye has a very limited area of approximately 6\xb0\xa0where objects appear clear and sharp, but our visual field is 120\xb0\xa0wide. When you are watching a movie or playing a game you can only clearly see the spot your eyes are focused on, but you can sense the whole 120\xb0\xa0area, including frame and background.\xa0\xa0 AmbiLED HD paints the background with the nearest colour and improves your visual experience. It also reduces your pupil size with extra light, and protects your eyes in the darkness.\n\n\n\n\nVisual Experience\xa0 \xa0It can be startling at first when you see a part of lightsaber or a blast effect beyond the boundaries of the screen.\xa0\xa0 If a car crosses the display fast enough, you will find yourself trying to follow it on the wall. After learns and adjusts to the screen limits, and you simply become immersed in the experience.\n\n\n\n\nHow can I install?\xa0\xa0Installation of AmbiLED HD is very simple and takes only 3-5 minutes depending on your screen size. The self-adhesive RGB LED strip is only 12mm wide, and is flexible and bendable. You can stick it to the sides of your monitor and bend it on the edges easily. The adhesive material on the strip is good quality and reusable. You can remove it and transfer the strip to another monitor.\n\n\n\xa0 There is no need to cut any unused part of the strip. Our AmbiLED HD driver software comes with a simple setup menu. Just count your LEDs that are used for your setup, and adjust the settings accordingly. It will disable any unused LEDs automatically. \xa0\n\xa0\xa0For the videos, we used a 37" Samsung LCD TV. The perimeter of this display was 290cm, and LED count was 172. After we entered this number into the AmbiLED software, it disabled the last 10cm of LED strip.You can simply bend this 10cm section to the back of your display, so that you can use it with a larger monitor in the future, or cut the excess off with a scissor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHardware Features\nOpen Source Hardware, Firmware & Software\nWindows,Linux & Mac compatible Arduino based hardware design\nFlexible & Bendable 12mm wide self adhesive RGB LED Strip\n14W/m powerful RGB LEDs (only 3W/m enough for AmbiLED HD)\n5V 3000mA wall adapter (capable of supplying up to 5 meters of LED strip)\nUK,EU or US wall adapter plugs depending on your location.\n3 meters flat USB Micro cable\non Windows\nAmbiLED HD orginally designed for Windows and using own software under Windows platform.Driver Software Features\nWindows compatible easy to use driver software\nSleep Mode Function\nBorderless Window Configurator(Pseudo Full Screen) for games.\nUser configurable light level.\nMicrosoft C# + DirectX based software design\nCapturing images directly from front buffer*\nWorks with all Windows applications except full screen games*.\xa0(*)Capturing from back buffer is the ban reason for most of game companies.

u'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe A Billion Entrepreneurs Foundation ("ABE") is a nonprofit organization that aims to plant the seed of entrepreneurship into generations of people throughout the world.\nWe do this by re-defining the word, \u201centrepreneurship\u201d to mean, \u201cTaking responsibility for outcomes,\u201d which ultimately means taking responsibility of one\u2019s life and current situation. A major catalyst was needed to jump start this movement, and spark people to get inspired to find their purpose in life, with the end result of living happier and more fulfilling lives. Therefore \u201cA Billion Entrepreneurs\u201d The Movie was created.\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\nFILM SYNOPSIS:A Billion Entrepreneurs is an inspiring film about finding your purpose to have more freedom, security and success in your life.In this transformational documentary, I\u2019ve been able to film some incredibly giving individuals, who want nothing more than to see more people experience freedom, security and success for themselves and their families. This film will allow countless people to learn from the examples of those who have traveled this same road, who have made the mistakes, who are willing to pass on valuable knowledge, secrets, and how-tos. In other words, give you a working blueprint to follow. Through their stories, we learn how to apply common principles to our lives, in order to achieve positive outcomes.\n\nABE cast and crew\n\n\nFOX 4Ward: A Billion Entrepreneurs\n\n\xa0I want you to imagine with me\u2026. An entrepreneur in every home!So my question to you is\u2026are you ready to be the entrepreneur in your home. Take the next step now.\xa0 Support this campaign, get your copy of this film,, find your purpose and declare, I AM AN ENTREPRENEUR! Based on this new definition of entrepreneurship\u2026which is \u201ctaking responsibility for outcomes.\u201d\n\n\n\n'
Current:
u'\nThank you for visiting our Kickstarter.Please help us on our global journey to spread this entrepreneurial spirit throughout the world!We believe that we all have a purpose.  We all have the desire to make a difference.  We are all hardwired for entrepreneurship. There are many people out there, maybe even including you, that feel that way, BUT don\u2019t know where to start or what to do.  You just go through your day, getting lost in the motions.It is very important to embrace entrepreneurship; but of course it isn\u2019t easy.  That is why this movie is being created.  It is the first step on a journey to help create a billion entrepreneurs worldwide.  By having an entrepreneur in every home,  we believe this will have a profound impact on the world and will inspire generations to come.  We plan on reaching our goal of a billion entrepreneurs by redefining the word entrepreneurship to mean \u201ctaking responsibility for outcomes.\u201d  When you take responsibility for outcomes, you are really taking responsibility for the decisions you make based on your purpose in life.  Just imagine how different this world would be if we had one billion people embracing this way of thinking.So in essence, the first step you must do is find your hearts purpose.  When you find your true purpose, life becomes easy.\n\nHow does one find their purpose?We are all born with a unique gift to share with the world.  That is our purpose in life.  We must do the work to first find our purpose and then share that purpose with the world.  It doesn\u2019t mean you have to start a business.  It just means to share your purpose.  Our hearts hold the answer.  Our purpose lies within our heart.  When we uncover that purpose and we start taking responsibility for that purpose, in that moment providence moves, and the magic starts to happen.  When you finally choose your purpose, you will feel a freedom that you have never felt in your life.  With this new found direction, you will have a clear path because all the other options and roadblocks go away. You are now \u201con purpose\u201d.Once you know your purpose, you must act responsibly to manifest that purpose to the world.  As you do so, you will begin to unlock the traits of an entrepreneur.  Once you do that, decision-making will become easier allowing you to achieve more freedom, security and success in your life.  You will officially be on the path of entrepreneurship.\n\nHelp us plant the seed now.  We need your help.This is where we need your help!We need this Kickstarter campaign to reach the minimum so we can continue to inspire entrepreneurship and encourage the global community to find their purpose, which will in return build a better world for all of us.This campaign will allow us to complete the movie.  Once the movie is complete, we will then be able to create tools and resources to assist those on their journey of entrepreneurship.If we don\u2019t reach the minimum, none of the backers will be charged and this film will be put on hold.Perks and BonusesWe want to give everyone a chance to really become a part of this movement of global entrepreneurship.  That is why we decided to offer huge values starting at the $1.00 contribution level.   In addition to being included in the movie and poster campaign, backers can receive a digital copy of the film for a $5.00 contribution.One of the numerous perks to contributing to the kickstarter campaign is to HAVE A PICTURE OF YOUR FACE IN THE FILM AND ON A LIMITED EDITION KICKSTARTER MOVIE POSTER.  We wish we could tell everyone\u2019s story, but we only have 90 minutes for the film.  By giving everyone the opportunity to have their face be part of this project, we are allowing the global community to share their story too.When you purchase the $40 DVD, you will receive over 6 hours of additional footage, including full cast interviews, behind-the-scenes footage, and special guest interviews.If you ask us, the NO-BRAINER LEVEL is the best level to get.  As an entrepreneur, you get to talk directly to the director about the filmmaking process, fundraising initiatives, or marketing tactics to help you plan your own endeavors.  Hear first hand from the guy in the pitt.Why is this film being made?The purpose of this film and project is to deliver a life changing message to people from all walks of life;  you can overcome obstacles, you can take control of your destiny and you can create a better future.  The film addresses situations that every-day people go through when striving for a better life for themselves and those dear to them.  We want people to realize that they are the CEO of themselves and they have the power to make a choice and change the world.  Why are we on Kickstarter?Using a platform like Kickstarter really allows us the opportunity to not only raise funds, but to validate the idea that  people want to take action, find their purpose, and live the life they were meant to live.  Kickstarter will allow us to connect with the people who truly want to see an entrepreneur in every home around the world.Why should I join the cause?You should join this cause only if you are tired of living a life that seems to run around in circles and you see no true results in your life.  They say the two best times to plant a tree is 20 years ago and today.  If you want to get more out of life and become the \u201cCEO" of you, you should join the movement.  You should also join the cause if you are someone who truly cares about spreading the seed of entrepreneurship in your inner circle and your community.What\u2019s the big picture.We realize that we can\'t reach a billion entrepreneurs with just a film alone. We recently created the A Billion Entrepreneurs Foundation to continue the process to see an entrepreneur in every home. We are currently creating relationships with organizations that align with our mission on entrepreneurship. Our primary objective is to provide grants to those aligning organizations to continue serving the entrepreneurial community with resources and programs. Later down the line, we may decide to develop and offer programs that help foster and assist entrepreneurs internally.Want to get started now.\xa0 Take the pledge of entrepreneurship.\xa0 Click on the pledge below.\n\nTake the ABE Pledge of Entrepreneurship Now.\n\nPlease see our full list of frequently asked questions below or submit your own question.

u'\nCopper is a documentary short about people living on the margins of society. The film\xa0takes a third-eye perspective, to tell the untold story behind the day-to-day hustle of scrappers battling drug addiction. \xa0Copper follows three individuals, all of whom are intravenous drug users (IDUs) living outside of homes, to document their success, failures, and the basic commonalities of everyday life.There have been films about scrapping.\xa0There have been films about people who shoot drugs.\xa0There has never been a film that portrays these individuals without defining them by their addiction.\xa0\nOur priority is to document the depth and complexity of these individuals\u2019 lives. It\u2019s been staggering to see the amount of work and daily resilience necessary to survive. The subjects of Copper persevere on the fringe -- finding value in what others have left behind.Copper isn\'t an exploration of right or wrong. \xa0It is a film that seeks to tell address the stigma placed on people who have been defined by where they live and the drugs they use.\xa0About the productionWhen you tell a person you are going to make a film documenting scrappers who are also drug users people tend to say one of two things. They ask you if it\'s safe, and they ask you how you are ever going to find people who will let you film them. We asked ourselves the same questions.Since last January we have been working with community leaders, outreach workers, advocacy groups, and anyone and everyone who could tell us about scrapping. Finally we decided we had to get out and start talking to people.It took months of hitting the streets to find the subjects for Copper. Our director and film crew have been waking up at 5:30 am -- walking under bridges, hopping fences -- in order to find injection sites to connect with people. \xa0Once we created relationships the team began to follow "Sam" and "Nick" in their daily routine. Through weeks of spending time with "Sam" and "Nick" we have captured an honest, intimate, and rare portrayal of the true complexity of this life.\xa0Why are we here?The Copper team is made up of six people, and we are all volunteers. We have invested our time and resources to get where we are today. The funds we raise with this campaign will allow us to continue to compensate the subjects of the film for their time (we provide gift-cards for food and other necessities), post-production costs, and will fund our ability to share this story with the world.Your support of this project will not only make all of these things happen, you will also help to begin to bridge the gap between perception and reality.\n'

u'\nMy take on Clouds (#CLOUD$) aims to highlight the increasing skepticism evident \nin the media about the monetary value of a liberal arts degree, particularly degrees in \u201csoft\u201d subjects \nlike the arts and humanities, and particularly as these degrees become increasingly expensive. We also propose to humorously grapple with outside perceptions of the students who attend elite colleges, or what we, from the inside, perceive these distorted assumptions to be.\nMy preparations for directing this show have been taking place for over a year now in the form \nof fellowships and coursework. I started my adaptation while working in Cyprus with the International\nAncient Greek Drama Festival there on a grant from the Garrett Albert Summer Fund. The previous \nspring, I had taken Helene Foley\u2019s Aristophanes course at Barnard, in which we translated Clouds. When I returned\nfrom Cyprus, I continued to work on the concept and look of #CLOUD$ for a final paper for Elizabeth\nScharffenberger\u2019s comedy class at Columbia last fall. Both professors have been vocal and instrumental in generating support for #CLOUD$. \xa0Aristophanes\u2019 Clouds was actually his least successful production, and the version we have \nhanded down to us by scribes may be one that was still being edited for re-performance at the time of \nAristophanes\u2019 death, which makes the show play a bit disjointedly. The play takes place predominantly at the \u201cThinkery,\u201d a haven for Socrates and \nother pasty intellectuals who swindle people out of money to teach them dubiously helpful things, like \nhow many feet a flea leaps. Unable to pick up on Socrates\u2019 wisdom himself, Strepsiades sends his \nson, a prospective chariot racer, to the school, in hopes that he will come back able to \u201cmake the \nweaker argument appear the stronger.\u201d When Pheidippides, Strepsiades\u2019 son, returns from the \nThinkery, his newly learned argument is that because his father is senile, he cannot make him do \nanything, and that it is the job of a good son to \u201ccare\u201d for an aging parent the same way his parents \ncared for him: by beating him when he did something wrong.\xa0My production takes much from the \noriginal but most notably diverges with respect to the role of gender in the identity of the Clouds (and, \nin my version, the capacity of Strepsiades\u2019 daughter, Mustang Sally, to become one of them).\nOur #CLOUD$ is very much controlled by the Chorus as the instigator of the action within the play, \nand expressing the identity of the Cloud Chorus is one of the main concerns of the show. Instead of airy \ngoddesses, the Clouds are comically distorted caricatures of young women from wealthy families who attend elite colleges like Barnard \nand Columbia. These women, because they come from money, think nothing of declaring \u201cuseless\u201d \nmajors, or taking "easy" courses, because their performance at college has no bearing on the success \nwaiting to be handed down to them upon graduation. They are literally untouchable, like the airy \ngoddesses of Aristophanes\u2019 original.\xa0The play itself follows Strepsiades, a New Jersey father indebted to his daughter\u2019s passion \nfor horses, on his quest to become a fancy talker, a manipulator, like the people who come out of \nthese hoity-toity liberal arts colleges. After failing to learn the finer talking points of intellectualism and \nliberalism, he sends his daughter, a more moldable youth, to study at Barnard. She returns a \u201ccrunchy \ngranola hipster,\u201d much to Strepsiades\u2019 dissatisfaction, and now has stronger views on dismantling the \npatriarchy than she does on finding legal loopholes to save her father. In a fit of rage, Strepsiades burns \ndown the projected fa\xe7ade of Butler Library.I think that mounting a \nproduction that is heavily adapted and in English will prompt debate about the strengths and \nweaknesses of my approach vis-\xe0-vis the approach of the\xa0Matthew Alan Kramer\xa0Fund, which supports \nonly productions in Ancient Greek and Latin. I hope our show will take a definitive stance within the \nGreek Drama adaptation and reception community about what it means to make a faithful production \nof a piece from antiquity and whether that means attempting to recreate aesthetics or experience, \nbecause it is truly impossible to successfully recreate both.\xa0\nI am asking for $2600 to support the production, half of which will go to reserving the theater \nalone. We will be using this funding additionally for costumes, props and publicity, with any leftover \ngoing towards shipping and high-quality printed donor rewards and framed posters for those faculty at Columbia \nwho have supported the production in any capacity, especially Liz Scharffenberger and Helene Foley.\xa0Our performances will be in the Glicker-Millstein Theater at Barnard College from October 28th to 30th, so even if you choose not to donate, come check us out! We\'ll be the ones in cotton ball tutus.For more information follow us on twitter @AncientDrama or on tumblr at\xa0http://bccuancientdrama.tumblr.com/\n'
Current:
u'\n#CLOUD$ is a modern take on Aristophanes\u2019 Clouds which confronts the \u201cvalue\u201d of a liberal arts education, emotionally, intellectually\u2026but mostly monetarily.  When Strepsiades\u2019 daughter, Mustang Sally, refuses to enroll at Barnard, Strepsiades decides to go in her place, and meets the magnanimous Socrates and his smitten Clouds.  When Strepsiades\u2019 dream to be edified by Socrates in the niceties of intellectual discourse (or, for regular people, to learn to talk all fancy-like) doesn\u2019t work out the way he planned, Strepsiades forces Sally to go, because she, unlike him, is still a moldable youth. When Sally returns from her time at Barnard, seeking a Masters in Art History rather than a JD, her father, overwhelmed by the pressure to pay back his and her student debt, decides to take matters into his own hands.\xa0\xa0Remaining faithful to the spirit of the original Clouds, and daring to take a stance on the generalizations about and growing pains of the oft-labeled \u201cMillennial Generation,\u201d #CLOUD$ is everything you didn\u2019t know you wanted to do on a late October weeknight.

u"\nThe quest for an ultra-light cooking solution\u2026Several years ago I was in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness cooking over a Coleman two burner propane stove waiting for water to boil. It was cool, rainy and there was a slight breeze. No matter how I moved the camp stove the wind seemed to affect my ability to cook, so I started to think about how I could make this situation better.\xa0Several generations later and a lot of field testing I came up with what I call the Critter CR2 and I believe that it resolves the problems that I had with commercially available camp stoves. Features like a low center of gravity and teeth on the main supporting structure virtually eliminate tipping your food over while cooking. A sleek design allows the CR2 to be packed nearly anywhere you can imagine.\xa0Whether you are a hard core hiker, canoeist, campground camper, biker or a weekend camper, the CR2 camp stove stand combined with your favorite stove makes for a simple and easy cooking experience anywhere you are.\xa0\n\n\n\xa0Production Plan Status: I am working with a manufacturer in Minnesota that is ISO 9001:2008 certified to manufacture samples and the first production runs.

u'\nFROM INVISIBLE CITIES TO CELESTIAL CITIESFor the past 5 years I\'ve been working as an illustrator, and every time I\'ve had a little spare time I\'ve found myself coming back to the novel Invisible Cities by Italo Calvino. It\'s become something of an obsession- I\'ve read and re-read it dozens of times, incorporated it into my architecture degree, based a solo exhibition on it, and produced limited edition screen prints inspired by its passages.\xa0My love of architecture and art have met as I\'ve been illustrating different cities, real and imaginary. With this project I\'ve taken things to a whole new level, looking beyond earth and imagining cities scattered out in space. The 9 prints I\'ve produced form a set representing the main celestial bodies in our solar system, from the Sun all the way out to Neptune.CELESTIAL CITIES PRINTS\nThe 9 prints in this series will each be a limited edition of 100, printed by hand using woodblocks, then signed and numbered. The paper I\'m wanting to use for these prints is Fabriano Rosaspina, a beautiful heavy cotton art paper.\n\n\nEach print measures 35cm x 50cm (about 13.5" x 19.5") including a white border. The textures will vary slightly between each print, and the final colours might be subtly different to the previews here (depending on what inks I use).\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you love the art but can\'t stretch to get your hands on the limited edition block prints, you can still help me out by getting A4 digital prints or a set of postcards, all printed onto heavy satin card.\n\nA4 digital print of \'Uranus\'\n\n\nPostcard set featuring all 9 of the Celestial Cities\n\nA NEW PRINTING PROCESS\nIn the past I\'ve worked closely with screen printers and printing presses to produce really high quality limited editions of my artwork, but recently I\'ve been wanting to get my hands a bit dirty myself.Earlier this year I experimented with a method that was entirely new to me - wood block printing - and I produced a small limited edition called Kites Over the Crags for a Gallery in Edinburgh. The results were tactile and beautiful, and I wanted to develop the method further.\n\nKites Over the Crags - the first print series I produced using bock printing\n\nThe printing process involves laser engraving my artwork onto wooden board, which then acts as a master block for all the prints. Inks are spread over the block, and each print is pressed by hand to produce the print. Using a laser engraved board means fantastic details can be achieved, while tiny inconstancies in the surface of the wood produce textures that make every print unique.\n\nLaser engraved wooden board for the \'Sun\' print\n\n\nEach print will be made individually by hand, using the engraved boards and block printing ink.\n\n\nTest prints show the subtle textures that the printing process produces.\n\nWHY I NEED YOUR HELPEven though I\'m printing everything myself by hand, there are quite a few big expenses that I need to overcome before I can get stuck in, like buying all the art paper, stocking up on inks and equipment, and making the remaining laser engraved wooden boards.

In my years of jogging the sidewalks of old town Fort Collins I have received many kind offers. These include fresh water, bandages, and vows never to park your lawn mowers and large vehicles in the sidewalk again. I thank you all for your consideration! \xa0 Unbeknownst to many of you, I am not just a jogger 24-7. I am a musician as well, and am proud to present the work entitled Cellophane Eyes. \xa0My good friend Sean Waters and I have spent about a year\'s time writing, arranging and recording this original work, a twelve song album of all original tunes composed by The Seers. \xa0We are a local grass roots project that has completed recording our album locally at Stout Studios, headed by sound engineer extraordinaire, Darren Radach. To support the project we have launched a thirty day campaign via kick starter. This includes a short yet comical video that combines blind jogging with a humorous way of promoting the new record. Even if you have little to no money to spend, I would hope for you all to take the time to watch this video and to see what Sean and I are up to with our original music. The Seers play songs that others have written for a living, but we want to share our own ideas too.\xa0\nSincerely,\nBrian Collins\n'

u'\nI have been living my life taking care of people and I am scare that life will pass me by without me living life and not getting to do something for me. I am really a basic girl that is not about the newest purse of what the latest fashion is. I have always been someone that craved to go back to a simple sort of life. I wanted to be on a piece of land somewhere living off the grid the best way I saw fit. I want to learn things I want to grow things. I want to go back to basics. From my homesteading up to this point it is a learn experience for sure. Some times you will do a project and you sit and think well I could have done that another way or what ever the case might be and you learn as you go. I know my homestead is not like others but that is what make us all different the freedom to live as we all see fit and I am just looking to be able to once live for myself and do what I want to do and I have only asked for a dollar because anything is better than what I started out with towards this project. I will be sharing everything I do so you at home can learn how to grow and produce food organically without the chemicals that seem to be everywhere. I hope to start a community garden were I can give the extra food grow to the local soup kitchens and food banks \xa0 so thanks for taking the time to read this\xa0\n'

u'\nMy project description would be more of a dream. My dream\nhas been my dream since I was a child. I wanted to have a yard and grow and\nhave livestock. But life is funny before you know it the years have passed you\nby and you were waiting for life to start and did not know life was already\nstarted. That is how I feel I was living life. I thought wow life is going to\npass me by without me doing all the things I wanted to do such as homesteading.\nI have never been one to want the newest purse or fancy rings. I have always\nbeen a basic woman that enjoys the simple things in life. About 3 years ago I\nstarted a small garden in my back yard in containers to test out if I could\ngrow things. I have learned that not only could I grow things I did it very\nwell and it was something I enjoyed more than anything else. So because I\nwanted to keep track of how well my garden was coming I started snapping photos\nand short little update videos of the process and posting them on my\nyoutube.\xa0 So I did that for about a year\nwhen I started posting them I thought no one would watch my videos\xa0 so it was done with the worst quality and low\nbudget camera in my cell as I did not own a camera and I had to use the only\nthing I had on hand.\xa0 But the more videos\nI would post the more views I would get . Then the comments and I realized that\nmakes me happy to be able to show people that yeah you can not only learn to\ngrow and do things for yourself but you can do it on a frugal budget. Because I\nhave been poor every day of my life and I am sure at this point Its really all\nI am comfortable with. Sure I would love not to worry if I can pay the lights\nnext month but who doesn\u2019t wish for those things.I want to be able to rebuild a homestead or if not a\nhomestead my garden again. I was told this year that I could use as much of my\nfriends 94 acres as I needed to have my dream. So I broke the golden rule my\ngrandmother warned me about my entire life about not putting all my eggs in one\nbasket. Because that is just what I did, as I moved every to the homestead land\nand spent weeks getting ready for the gardening season, Building green houses,\nbuilding homes for the animals. Tilling and planting so many things. \xa0When it did not work out with the friendship I\nlost everything and now need to start over\n'

(Hoping to ship very early in December, but please understand that I can't guarantee arrival before Xmas for international orders, sorry)Hello! The Raspberry Pi is a great device for learning about controlling hardware and, like many of you out there, I've enjoyed connecting LEDs to the GPIO pins and controlling them with Python.I had the idea to make a fun, festive GPIO project for the Pi and also to try out an interesting LED-interfacing technique called 'Charlieplexing'. The result is the GPIO Xmas Tree for the Raspberry Pi!If you look-up Charlieplexing on Wikipedia then you may think it's an intimidating technique but, really,\xa0it's quite simple. It has one big advantage: you can connect lots of LEDs to a small number of GPIO pins. My Xmas tree uses just four GPIO pins to control 7 LEDs (although\xa0four pins could drive as many as 12 LEDs!). I'll explain all about Charlieplexing in the updates as the campaign progresses and also in the final instructions, but don't worry if it sounds complicated: I'll provide plenty of examples of Python code that will make it easy.Why do I need your help? I think this is a fun project that many Pi-owners will enjoy, whether they just want a fun Christmas gizmo to solder, or whether they want to learn about Charlieplexing. However, PCBs are expensive to produce in small quantities and I need your help to place a big enough order to get the cost of the kit into the 'pocket money' price range (low-cost 'pocket money' electronics kits are a big project of mine at the moment: see my project at www.pocketmoneytronics.co.uk )\n \nThe PCB you see in the photo and video is very nearly the finished version: there's just a few small tweaks to be made that will help with soldering and programming.News regarding Charlieplexing: here's a video I've made about how the Charlieplexing works http://youtu.be/57wRBMdOm9U\xa0or you can read about Charlieplexing in this Kickstarter update: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1937541932/gpio-xmas-tree-kit-for-the-raspberry-pi/posts/1037203News regarding kit multipack: I've now added the option of 2 kits for \xa310 for UK backers... please feel free to update/adjust your pledge to take advantage of this option! ;-) If you're one of the kind people who has already bid a multiple of \xa36 for multiple kits, please contact me and I'll arrange something so that you're not out of pocket.International postage?\xa0I'm getting a few questions about international postage...

If we hit that value (i.e. \xa31080) then, as well as the yellow LED at the top of the tree, I'll include a 'bi-colour' LED which can be used in this position (read on for a few limitations, though). I've been experimenting with a nice Red/Green LED which can be red or green or, if you flick quickly between the two, a funny mixture of the two colours. There's a small limitation, though: the bicolour LED is slightly dimmer than the other red LEDs. This can be compensated for to some extent by modifying the software so that the bi-colour LED is illuminated for slightly longer in the sequence than the red LEDs and, consequently, I'd suggest its of most interest to more advanced experimenters (I'll post a suggestion to something that the less brave users can do with this LED instead, though!).

u"\nOne of my favorite hardcore punk bands is playing a rare show https://www.facebook.com/events/806791829365103/ I've seen them four times, and they put on one of the best performances I've ever seen. The last time they were town, I missed them because the venue was at capacity. I need your help to fly to Arizona, see the show, and then make a comic book about the experience. \n"
Current:
u'\nI\'ve been reading comic books for 21 years, going to punk rock shows for 17 years, and after 15 years of being unable to start a band, I\'ve been drawing comics for about the past two years.I grew up reading Marvel comics, which I still love, but as I\'ve gotten older my tastes have drifted more towards artists like Daniel Clowes, Adrian Tomine, Evan Dorkin, and Los Bros Hernandez. I\'ve been taking evening classes at the Sequential Artists Workshop, a small non-profit school for alternative comics creators, that just happened to open up right in my backyard a couple months after I split up with my wife. Without SAW, there is a good chance I would have left Gainesville by now.My previous comic, "Give Thanks" is a small slice of life dealing with the aftermath of that divorce. I will be selling it, along with the SAW student anthology, at the Small Press Expo, in Bethesda Maryland, September 13 and 14.Even though comics are my primary focus right now, punk rock has been a huge influence on me, especially the way it breaks down the barrier between artist and audience. About 14 years ago a band I had seen several times first approached me about setting up a show for them in my sleepy little hometown, giving me a crash course in DIY. My current Kickstarter project involves that weird intersection artist/audience and punk/comics. The band Hour Of The Wolf is not incredibly well known, but they have one of the most amazing live shows I\'ve ever seen, and I have gotten to be friends with them. Their singer is also a terrific painter and illustrator, and he has been a great source of encouragement for my art.They are having a reunion show in Arizona on September 26, and my goal is to be able to take off a couple of days from my day job (working for poverty wages in a public school with at-risk 6th graders), fly out to AZ, and make a comic book about both the trip and my relationship to punk rock in general, and Hour Of The Wolf in particular. My goal is very low, since I have access to cheap printing through SAW, and I\'m pretty well stocked on art supplies due to a recent liquidation sale at the local art supply store.Rewards include not only copies of my comics, but accommodations for The Fest, a massive punk rock event with over 300 bands in Gainesville, FL, Halloween weekend, as well as original art commissions. I will draw anything backers want, within the limits of my ability, India Ink on archival quality 9x12 bristol board. For comparison, check out the "Drawings You Want" series by Josh Bayer, another source of support and inspiration for me.Links - https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1173689085/hour-of-the-wolf-reunion-show-comichttp://philipaweiss.tumblr.com/http://instagram.com/genghiskohenhttps://www.facebook.com/events/806791829365103www.thefestfl.comhttp://joshbayer.tumblr.com/post/90232173961/upcoming-pages-for-thing \n'

Eleven local projects, five bands from across the country and the world, eight of which are new to HONK NYC! -- it is a true meeting of the horns, the dancers, the drums, the music and YOU!Meet Our Visitors: We have five bands coming to us this year!Three international groups:\nLes Muses Tanguent, an all-female ensemble from Paris, France;\n\nRadio Kaizman,\xa0 hip-hop New Orleans-influenced from Lyon, France;\nPakava It' - art ensemble from Moscow, Russia.\nTwo from the United States:\nChaotic Noise Marching Corps, from Seattle.And, in their 8th appearance at HONK NYC!:\nEnvironmental Encroachment, from Chicago.Meet our returning (and much beloved) NYC participants:\nFrank London's Klezmer Brass All-Stars (Our mentor in all things brass!);\n\nThe Himalayas, featuring Kenny Wollesen;\nRaya Brass Band;\nPitchBlak Brass Band;\nUnderground Horns;\nBatala NYC;\nWollesonic Lab's Sonic Massage.\nAnd of course, the HONK NYC! festival founders, Hungry March Band.\nNew York bands making their first appearance at HONK NYC! 2014 include:\nSpanglish Fly;\nLucky Chops Brass Band;\nThe Human Jukebox Brass Band;\nBombrasstico.\n\n\nEnvironmental Encroachment at Staten Island Community Charter School, 2012, Photo Courtesy of the School\n\nWHY KICKSTART HONK NYC!?It ain't cheap to throw this kind of party!As festival hosts, we have extended our couches, cars, kitchens and Metrocards towards as many of our guests (80+ this year!) as we can. The festival has outgrown us and we need your help.This year, as we did last year with our successful campaign, we aspire to offer real assistance to our visiting artists. Funds raised will go toward travel costs, hospitality, and housing. In addition to chartering a bus to bring visiting participants -- all 80 of them -- from from Providence, RI to NYC, we're daydreaming of giving them all per diems for food and local travel. This is in addition to the performance honorariums we\u2019re committed to offering all bands, which will inevitably be used to cover their travel costs to get to and from their hometowns.We know from experience that a happy, well-rested artist produces a superlative performance experience for all! Especially for those artists new to the city who don\u2019t know the MTA as well as they know their instruments. (And by the way, we are looking for volunteers to help with handling the artists, getting them to and from their temporary NYC homes to gigs, assisting them with subway navigation, etc. We\u2019re also looking for food donations for our participants and volunteers-only potluck on the night of October 14.)Our talented musicians and dancers are dedicated to bringing you the best show EVER!Another, and perhaps the most vital, element of HONK NYC! is you, our audience. The energy of our festivalgoers makes all the magic possible. In order to bring New Yorkers another spectacular year of HONK NYC!, our Kickstarter earnings will also cover production costs like\xa0promotion,\xa0permitting, and\xa0equipment rental.\xa0We want to ensure our artists sound and look great in front of substantial crowds at all of our shows.Lastly, HONK NYC! is committed to compensating participating\xa0local acts with a small stipend during the festival, as local musicians incur travel and production expenses of their own. In past years,\xa0our NYC-based HONK NYC! bands -- large ensembles themselves -- have often generously donated their own door-take to the visiting artists, in order to help their colleagues out with the hefty costs of playing in NYC.We think ALL of our festival participants should make more than $12 a gig (what we paid out per person in 2009).AND, we believe our audiences shouldn't have to fork over a full day's wage to attend a concert.With shows every single day from Monday, October 13 through Saturday, October 18, you will have nonstop opportunities to see and hear all of our artists! Find our schedule here and on our Facebook page.A bigger, better festival is within our reach!\n\nPerhaps Contraption at P.S. 10 for HONK NYC! 2013\n\nWe LOVE our School Program!\xa0\nWhat child doesn\u2019t love a moment to dance, sing, play music and express themselves? HONK NYC! believes all children should have the opportunity to enjoy the wonder and magic of live music. With the help of our Kickstarter backers, in 2013, our four guest bands played to over 2,000 school children in Brooklyn and Staten Island. We look forward to working this year again with our partner\xa0institutions:\nP.S. 10;\nP.S. 130;\xa0\nMaple Street School;\nStaten Island Community Charter School.\xa0\nMeet\xa0our presenting partners:\nOne Penn Plaza, curated by Ariana Hellerman, creator of Ariana\u2019s List;\nWFMU's Transpacific Sound Paradise, produced by WFMU DJ Rob Weisberg at Monty Hall, WFMU\u2019s new performance venue;\nLittlefield, scene of our opening night dance party, presented together with boomNYC, and thank you to our friend Brice Rosenblum at boomNYC for working with HONK NYC! since 2008!\nBarbes in Brooklyn, Olivier Conan\u2019s intimate venue;\nGowanus Open Studios at Gowanus Ballroom, hosts of our Friday Night Gala;\nMore Gardens, our East Village Cavalcade of Pomp co-organizers.\nHere is the Tine Tee - all different, all special, remixed and redesigned, as modeled by festival steward Sara Valentine, and accompanied by some employees of the TSA!\n\nHONK NYC!

u"\nSix days, 16 Bands, 12+ Concerts, 200 Musicians = HONK NYC!\nOctober 13 - 18, 2014Over two hundred musicians will play more than a dozen concerts across every borough of New York the week of October 13 - 18, 2014.\xa0A feast for the ears, enticing and delightful to the eye, HONK NYC! presents a wide range of music that everyone can dance to.

u"\nThe project and the about me really go hand in hand since I am the project. With the game of golf I have had more downs than ups with this game yet still cling to the possibility that I could play this game at the highest level. Right now with the cost of a good set of clubs being so high and working nights on an hourly wage it really doesn't cover the cost of being able to purchase them. This would be the first step on my road to becoming a Tour Professional. With the new set of clubs I would be able to start getting my golf game in order again. The reason I do not have clubs at the moment was that I was working at a golf course but with cost of living being so high all my money went to bills and food with one particularly bad month and unexpected bills I had to sell my golf clubs. My main goal is being able to acquire a sponsor to start playing the professional mini tours. These are also very expensive being you might need $40-50,0000 for year covering cost of living, play/practice time, traveling, coaching etc.... any money I receive over the cost of the equipment will go to pay for tournaments etc..\xa0 I am 33 years old, and have had a roller coaster of a time with golf in my life. I didn't get into the game till I was about 18. I got my handicap very low in my early 20s and did not play in college. I started playing the mini tours in Southern California when my then ex girlfriend decided to steal everything I own and leave me penniless. I decided to move out to AZ where my family was and start over, another time in my life where I had no golf clubs the game was forgotten for the next 7 years where I got into sales. What brought me back was when I went out and shot 71 first time on a golf course in almost a decade. I quit my sales job and got a job at a golf course. Playing and practicing I was able to get my game down to a +3 handicap and shooting mid 60s to low 70s consistently. The problem was that I had no money for tournaments and no contacts for a sponsor. Now here I am today, I gave up on golf over a year ago frustrated but it has never left my mind. I watch the television coverage every week dreaming I was there. This is pretty much one of my last shots at doing something. Thank you very much!\n"

Another long and cold winter is beginning in Northern Quebec. The local Cree community clash with rich industrialist W. Hamilton, copper mine magnate in the region. The Crees accuse the latter of destroying sacred lands for the sole purpose of increased profits. Suspiciously, Hamilton\u2019s summer residence and hunting manor\xa0is subject of vandalism and thefts. Convinced that the Cree are responsible, Hamilton calls Carl Faubert, a war veteran turned private detective, to handle the affair.Carl never refuses an easy case, especially when the client has such deep pockets. He jumps in his faithful pick-up truck and heads up north to meet with Hamilton.\xa0Unable to find his client at the meeting point, Carl starts to search for him. After knocking on some doors, the detective finds not only the rich man is missing... but the whole area is deserted.Where is the local population? What happened to Hamilton? Are the Cree involved? Welcome to K\xf4na, an episodic game about investigation, exploration, survival and the mysteries surrounding the disappearance of W. Hamilton and the neighboring inhabitants.\n\n\n\n\nK\xf4na combines the atmosphere and immersion of a modern survival title with the deep storytelling and puzzle-solving aspects of a traditional\xa0adventure game.ObjectiveThe main objective of the game is\xa0to\nsolve the mystery surrounding the disappearances. You can expect to do the following:\nExplore vast, open environments\nSolve various puzzles\nTry to locate people who could help solve the mystery\nSearch for clues (artifacts, notes) related to the investigation\n\nTake pictures of evidence\nSurvive\nAs you may have seen already, you actually get to drive Carl's Pickup Truck and, later on, a snowmobile. Unlike similar games in the genre, you have full control of the vehicles.\nChallengesK\xf4na is a game built for people with brains. There are no such things as waypoints or mandatory tutorials. You have to figure out how to progress in the game yourself, using the tools available to you.\xa0You also have to worry about your survival in those hostile northern lands. You\nmight need to use a weapon against unexpected threats.\xa0You could also get trapped\nin a bitter blizzard.\xa0If you are losing blood or freezing\xa0outside, your time is limited. You must heal your wounds or find warmth before it's too late.\xa0\n\n\n\n\nSimilar to games like Dear Esther and Stanley Parable, a narrator constantly adds depth to the game.\xa0The pieces of story that are revealed to you vary dynamically according to your in-game whereabouts and actions.\xa0Narrator PerspectiveK\xf4na's story is told through an omniscient third-person narrator. Imagine playing the main character of a captivating campfire tale. That\u2019s what this game is all about.\nThe StorytellerFor the French version of the game, the story is told by Fran\xe7ois Devost - an experienced storyteller who\xa0employs a style authentic for the character and time.\xa0For non French speakers, we\nbelieve that the game will be well worth playing at least once in its original\nlanguage - with English subtitles - to truly appreciate the unique, authentic\natmosphere of this rich historical mystery.Don\u2019t worry non French\nspeakers \u2013 the game\nwill also come with a professionally translated and recorded English voice\ntrack. In that regard,\xa0feel free to contact us if you are an English voice actor or if you would like to someone - it\xa0would be really helpful!The Story\nThe story is written by an talented writer, David B\xe9langer. David is a PhD student in literature at the Universit\xe9 du Qu\xe9bec \xe0 Montr\xe9al. He published his first book\xa0at the beginning of 2014 as well as several scientific publications over the course of his studies. His skills to play with words and to craft thrilling tales is crucial to K\xf4na's narrative.\xa0While we quickly translated some of his writings ourselves for the campaign, the final script will be translated by professionals. You can expect the final English version of the story to be equally as good as the French one!\n\n\n\n\nThe Format\nAs mentioned earlier, the game will be divided into four episodes. All these should take approximately the same time to complete as other popular episodic games (The Walking Dead, Kentucky Route Zero), which means between one or two hours on average, depending on the amount of time you take to explore the awe-inspiring environments.The GraphicsTo realise the K\xf4na world, we use several techniques such as image cross-processing, desaturation, high contrast, on-screen noise, strong bloom and vignetting\xa0to\ngive the game its 40-years-old-vintage look.\xa0VRSupporting virtual reality for the game is at the top of our wish list. K\xf4na would be awesome on the Oculus Rift. That unfortunately comes at a cost we cannot impose on all backers. Instead of being part of the base goal, the VR support will appear as the first stretch goal of this campaign.The MusicWe've reached out to and convinced Cur\xe9 Label, a folk-rock band from Quebec, to help us give the game a soundtrack that fits the period.\xa0Wondering\xa0how that sounds? Turn up the volume and play these samples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCombined with the savings we have in the company bank account, the $40,000 base goal is enough money for us to finalize our current design of the first episode.\xa0Needless to say, the more we get, the higher the quality of the game will be.Stretch GoalsWe plan to add stretch goals later, but we want to focus on getting to the base goal for now. When the campaign will get close to it, we'll work with the community to add meaningful stretch goals for our backers. VR and consoles being at the top of our current wish list :)Budget Breakdown\n$26,000 is the bare minimum that the three developers, the musicians, the narrator and the writer agreed to receive in order to create the first episode.\xa0We\u2019re doing it for the\nlove, not the money!\n~$10,000 for outsourcing (the English translation,\xa0some necessary sound design and animations)\n~$4,000 in administrative fees (Kickstarter and the bank)\nEven though our share of the money will barely pay for food and rent,\xa0we are passionate and committed\nto working for these minimum wages in order to realise our dream of seeing the\nproject successfully funded and completed.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlexandre Fiset (Producer, LinkedIn) has more than six years of experience in interactive media development, including four at Beenox, an Activision-owned studio. He also presided his local IGDA chapter for three years and gave many speeches in Quebec-based schools. With more than six credited retail 3D games, two as an Associate Producer, Alex has the expertise to drive the team to success. He also helps with the code, user interface and level design for the game.Etienne Lemieux (Artist)\xa0has more than three years of experience in interactive media development, including two years at\xa0Beenox. He creates shaders\xa0and 3D art assets for the game.Maxime Charbonneau\xa0(Programmer) finished his robotics engineering degree in 2012 and joined the two others to found Parabole.\xa0His\nprogramming skills and his knowledge in vehicle physics are essential to the game's development.\xa0UsSince we started the company, we've successfully convinced many businesses that we have the talent and expertise to create top quality interactive content.Now, we don't want our next client to just be some business. We want our next client to be you. We want to use our expertise to create unique games for everyone. The problem is, even with some contracts coming in, we don\u2019t have enough money to bring the project to quality and scale it deserves. The bottom line is, if you like what you see on this page and want to see this project in your game library, you can make it happen either by pre-ordering the game here or by sharing our project with gamers around you. In return, we promise to deliver one of the most unique first-person adventure games you\u2019ve ever played!\n"

u'\n***UPDATE***\nAs of 6 pm West Coast time on Monday, August 11th, we have reached my stretch funding goal of $7,000!I am totally floored. We reached the stretch goal in two days. This means that I am able to fully fund my dream album. I can afford the very best mixing and mastering and fully compensate all the other musicians and artists who are supporting me along the way.I need to figure out how to respond to this unexpected generosity! I will post another update soon.***UPDATE***As of 9:30 am West Coast time on Saturday, August 9th, we have reached the funding goal of $5,400!This is cause for celebration! The album will exist! I get to finish the project and send out all your rewards and throw a big CD release party. This is a wonderful feeling, to be supported by an extended community to live out my dreams. Thank you all so much.I have two new project goals, which will help me hugely as a solo, independent working artist.Goal #1: To reach 300 total backers!Goal #2: To reach $7,000!For more information on these goals and the motivation behind setting them, check out the update I just posted by clicking on "Updates" at the top of this page, above the video.-------------------I am making an album! A real, actual, full-length studio album! That is, I am hoping to make an album, but I need your help.I have been playing music and singing my whole life long, but it took me a couple of decades and some hard times to come around to becoming and owning my identity as a musician, a songwriter, and a performer. This collection of songs is the result of the last few years of heartache, loss, career change, resilience, love, and musical growth. I am proud of these songs and of who I have become through the process of writing them and I can\'t wait to share them with you!The songs for this album were all born out of losing someone close to me. My dad taught me to love and play music and he left me here on this earth with a song to sing and a voice to sing it with. Writing these songs over the past year has brought me peace, joy, pain, sorrow, and a great deal of healing. Through songwriting, I can create and process a narrative of his disappearance that ends up being beautiful and universal, despite the bizarre details of his loss. I hope that this album can offer that same healing journey to others.Making an album is expensive, and for good reason. This kind of project involves a lot of time and collaboration among many talented people who deserve to be well-compensated for their skills and effort (not to mention some super fancy equipment!). I have a great crew of people helping me, including a skilled engineer, Dan Rhiger at Medicine Whistle Studios in SE Portland, a wise and compassionate producer, Matt Meighan, and a whole bunch of extremely talented and generous musician friends who are adding harmonies and instrumentation to make these songs come alive. The cost of the project will include studio time, mixing, mastering, manufacturing, and compensation for the producer, studio musicians, artists, and friends who are helping along the way. If successfully funded, I hope to have the album finished and out by the end of November of this year.I am excited to turn to Kickstarter and crowd-funding to make this project happen. The thing I like about crowd-funding is that everyone who\n gives money is helping me front the cost of this project, much like a \nrecord label would have done in years past. If you give $10, you are essentially pre-ordering the album. By committing to buy it now, your purchase is actually helping to create the album. How cool!But here is the catch with Kickstarter - I need to hit that $5,400 goal to get any money at all for this project. I will have all my fingers and toes crossed for the next 30 days, hoping to reach that goal! Donate what you are able and share the project with others in your life you think might enjoy and be affected by this music. I am really excited about the rewards I will get to give out if this project is funded. First and foremost, AN ALBUM. Lots of CDs! CDs for everyone! Whoa. In addition, I am going to have some awesome art designed by a friend, Allison Staley, that will be screen-printed onto limited edition T-shirts. And recordings of your favorite cover songs! And fancy shmancy Executive Producer cred! And even a house concert anywhere in the continental United States! And everyone who gives any amount will be on the list for the CD release party in Portland (date and location TBD) so we can all party together and celebrate! All of you who don\'t live in Portland should come to Portland and join us. Winter in Portland is wonderful...if 45 degrees and rainy is your favorite kind of weather.Thank you so much for checking out my Kickstarter page. I hope you will be a part of this community of people helping me to get this music out into the world. It is a leap of faith to put this out there, but I believe in this album and I believe that we can make it happen. Let\'s do this!\n'

u"\nThink you know about Nancy Drew?My name is Quincy MacShane and I am the creator of the Nancy Drew Board Game, a tabletop game that will educate girls around the world about a fantastic role model, Nancy Drew.Many famous women cite Nancy Drew as an influence toward shaping their success. Some of these include:\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Barbara Walters, Fran Lebowitz, Laura Bush, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Gayle King, Diane Sawyer, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Congresswoman Pat Schroeder among others. \xa0Through the creation of The Nancy Drew Game, I hope to encourage a new generation of girls to rediscover Nancy and learn about the series through a fun and interactive board game experience.The Nancy Drew Board Game is a trivia game designed for 2-4 players. Players dive into the Nancy Drew universe, learning about the adventures of Nancy Drew throughout the 56 book series.I've created a fun, educational game that serves as a continuation to the beloved Nancy Drew Book series.\n\n\nI've\xa0licensed\xa0the right to produce this game from\xa0Simon & Schuster and they have been very supportive of my efforts.\n\n\nPut your detective cap on, it's time to get sleuthing.Setting up the game:At the beginning of the game, the 56 bookcards are shuffled and 20 are placed into the 20 grey and black positions around the board. \xa0Because of this approach, each game starts off differently and no two games proceeds the same way.\nEach player chooses a character, Nancy Drew, George Fayne, Bess Marvin, Ned Nickerson, Dave Evans, Burt Eddleton, Carson Drew, or Hannah Gruen, and then picks a token to move around the board based on dice roll. \xa0Ideas for tokens include, a magnifying glass, flashlight, or perhaps Nancy\u2019s roadster.To determine who goes first, all players roll the dice and the player with the highest total starts the play the next players follow clockwise around the board. Each player places their token in the top right corner of the board, then throws the dice and moves their token clockwise the number of spaces indicated by the dice.\n\n\nGame Play:When a player lands on a book title, they will be asked, by the player to their right, a trivia question related to the book, from Nancy\u2019s Notebook. \xa0Nancy\u2019s notebook contains 4 questions for each of the 56 original Nancy Drew books. The first, a multiple choice question followed by 3 harder single answer questions. \xa0If the player answers the trivia question correctly, that player is given a bookmark (paperclip) to place over the corresponding trivia question number they just answered. \xa0The player who answers the question correctly and has a bookmark on the bookcard is considered to be \u201cbrowsing\u201d the book.\n\n\nUnlike Monopoly, we will not charge visitors for stopping by to browse the titles, instead, those who land on the bookcards may attempt to challenge and take possession of a title by trying to answer the next question in Nancy\u2019s Notebook relating to that title. If the challenger answers the question correctly, that player removes the other player\u2019s bookmark and places their own bookmark on the bookcard covering the question number they just answered. \xa0Once all four trivia questions have been answered, the book is removed from the board and added to the \u201cpermanent collection\u201d of the player who answered the final question. \xa0At this point, another bookcard from the library is placed in the empty slot and game play continues. \xa0\n\n\nPlay until there are none left. Clues and Evidence:In the four corners of the board are either question marks (Challenge Clue) or magnifying glasses (Advancing Evidence).If a player lands on one of the question marks (Challenge Clue) that player can try to take a title away from any other player by answering the next question in Nancy\u2019s Notebook relating to that title. \xa0If the challenger answers the question correctly, the challenger removes the other player\u2019s bookmark and places their own bookmark on the bookcard covering the question number that was answered correctly and moves their token to the title from which they will continue to play once it is next their turn. \xa0If that is the 4th question, the challenger may remove the title from the board, add that book to their collection, and replace it with another bookcard from the Library. \xa0If challenger answers the question incorrectly, the challenger leaves their token at the Challenge Clue position on the board on which they originally landed and the challenged player may advance their bookmark forward to the next number on the card corresponding to the question number that the challenger answered incorrectly. \xa0If that is the 4th number, the challenged player may add that book to their collection. \xa0A player who lands on Challenge Clue may also choose to skip or pass on this opportunity to challenge another player.If a player lands on one of the magnifying glasses (Advancing Evidence), they are given an opportunity to answer a question form one of the titles they are currently browsing to advance that title toward their permanent collection. \xa0If the player answers the question correctly, they may move their bookmark forward to the number corresponding with the question they correctly answered and moves their token to the title from which they will continue to play once it is next their turn. \xa0If the player answers the question incorrectly, the player\u2019s bookmark will be removed and the book will be taken off the board, replaced by a new title. In this case, the player leaves their token at the evidence spot on the board on which they originally landed.\n\n\nTo Win:The game continues until all the titles are either removed from play or added to the book collections of the respective players. Player count the number of titles in their collection and the player with the most titles wins.With the money from Kickstarter, I will put my game into production and have it on the shelves in local retail stores as well as be available for online purchase.Finally, thank you to KickVids for providing me with a video for this project!\xa0Video\xa0music by Emeline Easton\n"

The game will also include a replay system allowing the player to share footage on youtube. Vehicles are also included in the game, which you may happily crash into the buildings. Buildings can fall down (you can still do parkour even if the buildings are destroyed) The game combines fast pace gameplay with strategic game play, this allows for quite interesting results.The game will have multiplayer (up to 20 players at the moment), it will offer loads of things to do including racing, team deathmatchs et cetera. The player will have numerous abilities including time control, physics control, focus (slo motion), jetpack and special powers which can alter everything such as building can be broken or one player uses their telekinesis to throw a cube at another player, the possibilities are endless.The funding will be put towards making the game more fluid and fun to play.\xa0\n'

The 0.0.2 update was a big update it added destructable geometry, a expanded city (was all functional) and improved physics and shaders.

Current:
u'\nRemedy Resolutions was founded by five high-school students from around the United States. At a National Student Leadership Conference, we came together and decided that we wanted to make a difference in the world. Together, the five of us identified the problem we wanted to address: the gap between those that can donate and those that need charities\' funds. Our idea of an iTunes application that metaphorically "closes" this gap stems from this realization. Essentially, Remedy Resolutions is an app designed to make the process of donating easier. From global humanitarian organizations to local pet shelters, Remedy has plans to incorporate all types of charities in their convenience-oriented application. Instead of having to research individual charities and enter credit card information, Remedy Resolutions is a "one stop shop" for donations. However, advertising and developing the app itself is costly, so we felt as though Kickstarter would be an excellent solution to our financial challenges. We are committed to making this world better for future generations, but we cannot do it alone. In the words of Margaret Mead, "never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it\'s the only thing that ever has."

When unlikely collaborators like Broad Street Ministry and Federal Donuts join forces \u2013 new possibilities emerge. Getting in the game together leads us past helplessness, and allows us to envision radical new solutions.-Rev. Bill Golderer, Founder and Convening Minister, Broad Street MinistryThe Case for Rooster Soup Company\xa0Rooster Soup Company is a joint venture of Federal Donuts, Philadelphia\u2019s homegrown fried chicken-and-donut shop, and Broad Street Ministry, a broad-minded faith community providing social services and meals to vulnerable Philadelphians.\xa0Rooster Soup Company intends to open a gourmet soup restaurant in Philadelphia. Using chicken backs and bones from Federal Donuts, we can make delicious, inventive soups. The capital raised through Kickstarter will be used to lease, fit out and staff a location for Rooster Soup Company.What if people knew, that simply by buying lunch, they would be helping to improve the life of a Philadelphian in need? The profit on a single bowl of soup is roughly equal to the cost of one meal and social services for a guest at Broad Street Hospitality Collaborative.\xa0All of the profits generated from selling tasty soups to the general public will flow directly to Broad Street Hospitality Collaborative. This year, they will serve more than 60,000 meals alongside essential social services to 3,500 unique people.\xa0\nBroad Street Hospitality Collaborative offers a mailing address to over 1,850 Philadelphians in need of a connection to society and a place to receive identification; essential personal care items from razors to toothbrushes to 5,000 pairs of underwear and 6,500 pairs of socks in 2013; almost 4,000 changes of clothes and 1,200 mended garments a year; legal representation; therapeutic arts; and access to medical and behavioral health nurses.\xa0Rooster Soup Company will turn useful scraps into a sustainable annuity that supports Broad Street Ministry\u2019s vision of providing radical hospitality and meals to the Philadelphians most in need.\xa0\n\n\nASSETS\xa0Rooster Soup Company has a constant, free or low-cost source of stock: Federal Donuts currently discards enough chicken bones to produce about 2,000 bowls of chicken soup each week.\xa0Rooster Soup Company won\u2019t serve just any chicken soup. This soup will be made from free-roaming, antibiotic-free, air-chilled birds that are raised on a 100% vegetable, GMO-free diet. This chicken soup will be made by people who know chicken.\xa0Rooster Soup Company projections call for annual revenues in excess of $500,000, with net profits of $50,000 annually, growing to $100,000 as the business matures. This represents a return on capital of more than 20% a year. Our projections are based on over ten years of experience opening and operating restaurants, including similar operating models in Philadelphia.\xa0Rooster Soup Company is an opportunity to pilot a social venture in a city that has always innovated around food and fun.\xa0Rooster Soup Company will fill a hole in the lunchtime market where the greatest soup you\u2019ve ever had belongs. The bones and backs from our uncaged, air-chilled, antibiotic-free birds make a superior, nutritious chicken stock that can be the base for a multitude of delicious soups. Rooster Soup Company is unique, creative collaboration between a nonprofit organization and a for-profit business.\xa0Rooster Soup Company is a chance to create a sustainable revenue stream for a nonprofit that makes a difference in the Philadelphia community, as opposed to making a one-time donation.\xa0\n\nA group of volunteers ready to serve lunch at Broad Street.\n\n\nRev.

Current:
u'\nIn Philadelphia there is a place \u2013 five places, actually \u2013 where you can get the best fried chicken and donuts of your life at the same time.\xa0It\u2019s called Federal Donuts, and all we do is make donuts, fried chicken and coffee.Because we buy whole chickens, we have backs and bones we can\u2019t use, and have to pay to have them taken away and disposed of \u2013 about 1,000 lbs of chicken per week, in fact, from the highest quality, air-chilled chickens, that are raised on an all-vegetable diet without antibiotics.Stuffing a landfill with 1,000 pounds of nutrition every single week is not only absurd, it\'s twice as ridiculous when people are going hungry here in Philadelphia.At first, we thought we would make soup to feed hungry people. We soon found out there was an opportunity to make an even bigger impact by forging a more powerful partnership.Philadelphia is the poorest large city and the hungriest Congressional District in America.  If all you want is a meal, there are ample places to get fed.  But there\u2019s only one place where those Philadelphians experiencing hunger, homelessness, and poverty are served a meal, can receive essential services, and feel part of a community.Every week, 1,200 people come to  Broad Street Hospitality Collaborative\xa0to eat a healthy and delicious meal (prepared by an Executive Chef and served tableside by volunteer waitstaff), to check their mail, or to get a change of clothes.Most importantly, vulnerable Philadelphians come to Broad Street Ministry\u2019s Hospitality Collaborative to feel at home.But the demand at Broad Street\u2019s Hospitality Collaborative grows every day and what Broad Street Ministry truly need more than anything else is money.That\'s when we realized: Turning delicious chicken into money is something we\'re good at.We want to turn our practically free chicken stock into tasty soups that you can buy. And we\'ll donate 100% of the profit from every bowl to Broad Street\u2019s Hospitality Collaborative.Based on our 10 years experience in the restaurant industry, we forecast annual profits at Rooster Soup Co. of $50,000 the first year, growing to $100,000 annually after five years. Even just the first year\'s $50,000 in profit can supply 24,272 meals to needy guests.That\'s why we\'re asking for your help to open the Rooster Soup Company, and turn this into a reality.Better than a one-time gift\u2026Instead of a one-time donation, your Kickstarter dollars will help us build a perpetual money machine: Nearly-free chicken stock in, jobs and donations out. You\'ll help us create a model of monetary giving free of the extra work required for grants and traditional donor models. Does that sound unusual? That\'s because it is! We\'re veterans of the hospitality industry - at every price point.  We can make it work with your help. Below, you\'ll find detailed information on how our profit donations will deliver for those in need, who our giving partner is, what your Kickstarter backing is needed for, and how else you can help. In short, though:We want to use high-quality chicken backs & bones that would go to waste\u2026\xa0\u2026 to make delicious soup to sell\xa0\u2026 and donate 100% of our profits to a local organization dedicated to helping those in needAnd we can\'t do this without your help. That\'s why we\'re Kickstarting the startup capital needed to set up the restaurant, in order to start serving up soup & generating revenue for Broad Street Hospital Collaborative.Please join us in giving a sustainable hand up to vulnerable Philadelphians.Why Federal Donuts and the Broad Street Hospitality Collaborative joined forcesThe Broad Street Ministry Hospitality Collaborative offers four meals per week, serving approximately 1,200 Philadelphians experiencing hunger, homelessness, and poverty.  This year, Broad Street\u2019s chef will prepare over 60,000 individual platings.  Broad Street distributes personal care items like underwear, socks, deodorant, and soap in a way that affirms the dignity of its guests, over 43,000 such items last year.  And Broad Street serves as the mailing address for over 1,750 people in need of a home base.  In addition to receiving correspondence with loved ones and prescription medication through the mail service, having a mailing address is the first step to getting an identification card or a job.  The Broad Street mail service handled over 52,000 pieces of mail in 2013.Those are the nuts and bolts.  More broadly, the Hospitality Collaborative is committed to bringing healing through hospitality.  The Hospitality Collaborative uses a cutting edge trauma-informed, harm-reduction model, combining best practices from a wide variety of fields and emphasizing a sense that there is always enough for everyone.  How does it work?First, trauma-informed means that the staff and volunteers at Broad Street assume that everyone who comes through the doors has undergone trauma due to hunger, homelessness, or poverty.  It means that the Hospitality Collaborative does everything possible to reduce anxiety and not trigger a trauma response.For example, no guest at Broad Street ever stands in a line.  When most of us stand in line, we trust that we\u2019ll get what we\u2019re waiting for when we get to the front of the line.  But for Broad Street\u2019s guests, the experience is often a long time waiting\u2026 for nothing.So guests of Broad Street choose where they\u2019d like to sit at round tables with centerpieces and tablecloths.  And then volunteers come and bring them a beautifully plated, delicious and nutritious meal on real china with metal forks and knives.  Most importantly, no one waited in line for it.Second, harm-reduction means that we assume Broad Street is the safest place for our guests to be.  Many guests of Broad Street struggle with mental illness and are sometimes talking to people we can\u2019t see or saying things that many of us would find scary or unsettling.  Broad Street commits to getting to know these guests, focusing mostly on making sure they feel safe and comfortable.Broad Street is committed to making sure that guests, especially those in distress or struggling with a mental illness or addiction, know they are safe at the Hospitality Collaborative.  They don\u2019t need to leave or rush through their meals.  Broad Street doesn\u2019t have any metal detectors and doesn\u2019t employ any uniformed security - and hasn\u2019t had to call law enforcement in over four years.The bottom line is that Broad Street Ministry is not a soup kitchen, it\u2019s a household.  The trauma-informed, harm-reduction model demonstrates our commitment to radical hospitality, the dignity of every person, and the long-term flourishing of our guests.With your help, we can create a perpetual revenue stream to keep the Hospitality Collaborative strong in the face of ever-increasing need. The Rooster Soup Company\u2019s innovative profit-non-profit model will help Broad Street scale\r\n \r\nIn 2013, Broad Street Hospitality Collaborative served 51,700 meals to 3,500 individual people, up from 23,600 meals in 2012. Need is increasing at an incredible pace. At the same time need is growing, state and federal funding is shrinking -- creative, collaborative funding sources are more necessary than ever. With your help, and Rooster Soup Company\'s projected first year profits, we can supply 24,272 meals to vulnerable guests. That will go a long way towards helping Broad Street serve everyone who needs it. And with your help, and hard work, and luck, we can grow that profit every year to help Broad Street help the increasing number of people vulnerable to economic upheaval.Okay, how can I help? What will my Kickstarter money buy?\xa0Our goal of $150,000 sounds like a lot of money, but it\u2019s actually not enough to open a restaurant like Rooster Soup Co. \r\nThankfully, we have a few heavy-hitter donors who are willing to donate an additional $100,000 to complete our startup capital\u2026 if we can fully fund this Kickstarter to prove the Philadelphia community will support us.\xa0That\'s why we truly need your help. We cannot do this without you.\xa0Here\'s exactly how your money will be used\xa0If we are fully funded, we\'ll receive our private donor match, and allocate our $250,000 in total startup capital as follows:\xa0$125,000 will go to renovate our retail location for Rooster Soup Co.\xa0$90,000 in furniture, fixture and equipment \u2013 most of that number is kitchen equipment.\xa0$2,000 in licenses and permits.\xa0$15,000 in professional fees to a lawyer, architect and accountant.\xa0$5,000 in opening food inventory.\xa0$13,000 working capital and pre-opening expenses: training staff, buying business cards, electricity bills and everything else.\xa0We\'ve done this before; we\'ve run the numbers, and we\'re doing things as lean as we reasonably can.\xa0You might wonder why certain things cost so much \u2014 a very reasonable question!\xa0We need to ensure that the restaurant can turn out enough soup to turn a profit, and of course become a place customers will want to visit and revisit. \r\nOur experience has proven that spending less may put a ceiling on our potential, especially if it impacts our production capacity, or our ability to attract & retain customers. That would make it much harder to meet our profit goals.\xa0Our goal is not just to open a restaurant, but to earn a net profit of $50,000+ per year, based on our projections, plus create ten full-time jobs for local people.\xa0In just over three years, Rooster Soup Company\'s charitable giving will eclipse its startup capital\u2026 and continue to do so for many years.\xa0Think of Rooster Soup Company as an investment annuity for our neighbors in need.\r\nWe can generate a higher profit for a good cause\r\nWith dramatically reduced food and kitchen costs because of our free source of chicken stock, Rooster Soup Co. projects a profit margin of 20%, a vast improvement over the standard restaurant profit margin of 12%.\xa0What we\'re personally contributing\xa0Opening and operating a successful restaurant is incredibly difficult and time-consuming, requiring thousands of hours of up-front planning, development and implementation.\xa0The principals of Federal Donuts and Broad Street Hospitality Collaborative are contributing our time and expertise at no cost to Rooster Soup Company.\xa0Post-opening, the principals will continue to provide management, oversight, strategy and marketing services to Rooster Soup Company at no cost.\xa0Federal Donuts is also contributing the primary ingredient of Rooster Soup Company, chicken stock, practically for free. This ongoing contribution will create significantly enhanced profit margins, effectively creating a multiplier effect on the amount of money Rooster Soup Company is able to contribute to the Broad Street Hospitality Collaborative.\xa0We\'re the best people to start & run this innovative profit/non-profit model.We have the ingredients for soup and we know how to set up and run a successful, sustainable, profitable restaurant. If anyone can make this work, and continue working for years and years, it\'s us.\xa0Not to toot our own horns, but\u2026\r\nSteve Cook and Mike Solomonov of CookNSolo have over 10 years\u2019 experience opening and operating restaurants in Philadelphia, including Zahav, Percy Street Barbecue, and Federal Donuts.\xa0Federal Donuts has been critically acclaimed in the press by The New York Times, Saveur, Bon Appetit, and USA Today, and has appeared on national televisions shows\xa0The Chew, Unique Sweets, BrewDogs, 1st Look, VH1 Big Morning Buzz, and has an upcoming July 2, 2014 appearance on Good Morning America.\xa0Our restaurant Zahav is one of only five restaurants currently ranked Four Bells: Superior, Philadelphia Inquirer critic Craig LaBan\u2019s highest designation. Mike and Steve were named "Empire Builders," in 2012 by Food & Wine magazine.\xa0In 2011, Mike Solomonov won the James Beard Foundation Award for Best Chef: MidAtlantic, which is like winning an Oscar for your food.\xa0Broad Street Ministry\u2019s no slouch either.  The Hospitality Collaborative\u2019s unique approach to serving those in need has been covered by the Philadelphia Inquirer, Daily News and City Paper, as well as the Huffington Post.\xa0In addition to the Hospitality Collaborative, Broad Street Ministry has a robust residential worshiping community that meets every Sunday and is committed to being a progressive religious voice.\xa0We love Federal Donuts but Broad Street Ministry is no stranger to unlikely hospitality partnerships.\xa0Broad Street Ministry has been recognized for the exemplary way it uses its 114-year old neo-Gothic building.\xa0Broad Street Ministry Founder and Convening Minister Rev. Bill Golderer is a 2014 recipient of the Steppy Homelessness Advocacy Award.\xa0Prior to founding Broad Street Ministry, Bill was the founding Director of the Center for Church Life at Auburn Theological Seminary in New York City.  Before that, he worked as a pastor in Chicago and in electoral politics in Washington DC.\xa0Read more about Bill here.\xa0And if you want to see Bill on tv, he appears in the current season of The Bible Rules, on H2.\xa0Our legal structure reflects our mission\xa0Rooster Soup Company will be an independent entity jointly controlled by Federal Donuts and Broad Street Ministry. We won\u2019t be a legally designated as a 501c3 non-profit because Rooster will not be directly performing charitable work, but instead will create a revenue stream for Broad Street Hospitality Collaborative.\xa0Joint ownership is important to us; this is not some super-secret profit-making venture.  100% of our net profits will go to Broad Street Hospitality Collaborative, which will be clearly spelled out in our operating agreement, along with all other corporate governance issues. Although the operating agreement does not exist yet, we anticipate that each party (Federal and Broad Street) will have negative control over material changes to operations, assets, etc. Specifically, no changes could be made to the provisions governing profit distributions without everyone\u2019s consent.Net profits basically means whatever is leftover after we pay all of our expenses (food, labor, rent, utlities, etc.).  This will all be calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles and reviewed by an independent accountant. Neither Federal Donuts nor CookNSolo nor anyone else involved will charge a management fee to Rooster, other than any person who may be directly employed as a manager at Rooster Soup.  We do not believe there is any tax benefit available to Federal Donuts from its relationship with Rooster Soup Company. \r\n \r\nFederal Donuts will contribute the primary ingredient (chicken backs and bones) of the soup to Rooster Soup at no cost, period.  While it is our intention to make the soup itself (or at least the chicken soup base) as low cost as possible, we also realize that there are ancillary costs associated with turning chicken bones into soup, including vegetables, utilities, labor and transportation.  If these hard costs rise to a level that materially impacts our Federal Donuts business, we will look to recoup these costs. In any event, Rooster\'s food cost will be significantly lower than if it did not have this free source of chicken bones.\r\n \r\nThe #1 priority of Rooster Soup is to make as much money for Broad Street Ministry as possible.\xa0You\'ve made it all the way down here\u2026Please, would you help us use what would be thrown away to create jobs and sustainably fund hospitality for our neighbors in need?Even $20 will help us get that much closer to fully funded\u2026 and the matching donations from our private donors.\n\nA group of volunteers ready to serve lunch at Broad Street.\n\n\nRev.

You can purchase Choice or Prime sub primal cuts from your favorite butcher for say $10.00 to $14.00 per pound. Savings of at least 50%\xa0\n\n\nIn the past, you were not able to professionally and safely dry age your own steaks. Until NOW, we bring a \xa0brand new perspective to\xa0your home (or even small commercial property) grilling with the best dry aged steaks completely under your control.\xa0Now the joy of grilling your own dry age steaks is a reality with this truly unique home dry age steaklocker.\nThat's how easy it is...\nStep one: \xa0buy your favorite sub primal cut from your favorite butcher. Best results are assured with bone-in sub primal like Ribeye and Sirloin or a combination of those two.\n\n\nStep two: place it in the fridge.\nThat's it. Let it rest (dry age) for at least 21 days or longer depending on your desired flavor profile, then cut yourself your own individual steaks.\n\n\nMODERN TECHNOLOGY PAIRED WITH OLD WORLD TECHNIQUES\nSteaklocker's first production line run is offered in a standard 34 inch cabinet size.\n\n\nSteaklocker is developing \xa0a state of the art digital hygrometer controller (patent pending)\xa0allowing you to adjust the recommended settings to vary the flavor and tenderness of the meat.\xa0\nWe are developing our own smart phone app (IOS & if stretch goal achieved, Android) specifically for the dry age fridge. The primary application is the real-time digital sensor and controller (patent pending)\xa0that provides you with instant feedback on the critical temperature\xa0and humidity operations of the fridge. Until now, only the absolute high end humidors and fridges were able to control humidity inside the fridge. This equipment would cost anything from $ 5,000 up. Our (patent pending) modular digital\xa0hygrometer controller will use modern I-technology to achieve this.\n\nIMP Sensor Schematic\n\nThis sensor is bluetooth enabled and once linked up through the IMP sensor system, integrates seamlessly into Steaklocker's own smart app. This allows you to\xa0connect in seconds using just your smartphone.\xa0\n\n\nThis feature will alert your smart-phone when preset values are exceeded. This nifty element will ensure you won't loose your dry age product investment if power failures or other emergencies occur.\n\nSteaklocker Smart App (IOS)\n\nAdditional smart app features such as provenance information, complete step by step dry aging operational instructions, nutritional and caloric information for major recipes, top 100 dry age beef supplying farms\xa0and\xa0top 100 best steakhouses\xa0will all be available to ensure you have the very best Steaklocker experience. A 1-800 rapid customer service help number will also be provided.\nSOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT KIT (SDK)\nSteaklocker's smart app is planning to be as open as possible. It generates streams of data that can be used or stored and applied in many different ways. We will develop more connected speciality refrigeration and other devices for niche markets. In order to take advantage of the talent out in the market, we want to enable suitably interested people to develop software and hardware solutions that will work with as many\xa0device\xa0as possible. We're hoping to create an ecosystem of connected useful and practical culinary devices - that's why we\u2019re making our SDK available to dedicated parties.\n\nSteaklocker SmartApp (IOS)\n\nNew development option such as a live optic feed, sensor driven grilling thermometers and many other features are in development and are estimated for release in future months.\nOther Design Features\nWe have designed our dry age fridge based on our commercial success with steakhouse dry age environments. We have designed a unique modular hygrometer controller (patent pending) that is completely independent of the internal display sensor to ensure that internal humidity is achieved at optimal levels. Another first in dry aging technology.\n\nLatest Modular Humidity Controller\n\nSteaklocker has other optional features such as Himalayan Salt Blocks and\xa0Special Herb and Spice Silk Pouches that deliver additional flavor, taste and intensify the natural beef aroma.\xa0\n\n250m years in the making - Himalyan Salt Blocks\n\nBeautiful designs includes a sleek UV resistant stainless steel, UV protected tempered glass door and modern luxurious chrome handle bars.\xa0\n\n\nThe inside is enveloped with food grade black embossed aluminum with 2 removable extending chrome shelves for the dry age product. Hanging the cuts from the upper shelf is also possible with this design.\n\n\nSteaklocker's aesthetics are designed to co-ordinate with all of your other appliances or can be installed as an eye catching display case in your kitchen or courtyard BBQ area.\n\n\nTechnical Specifications:\n750 BTU powerful compressor\nFan Forced air flow\nPrecise Temperature range - 33F to 68F\nSmart Application Sensor Control - Bluetooth enabled\nFiberglass/Metal exterior with embossed black aluminum interior\n2 pane glass UV protected stainless steel door\nDigital temperature and humidity display\nActive carbon odor filter (replaceable)\nStandard Cabinet Size\n2 full extension adjustable and removable chrome wire shelves\n65 lbs. dry aging product capacity\nInterior germicidal sterilization lamps\nSelf closing door with lock\n37dba sound rating\nWhat is Dry Aging\nDry aging does for red meat what cave aging does for cheese or cellaring for Bordeaux \u2013 it\xa0improves the taste greatly with time. In addition, it will tenderize the meat after approximately 18 - 21 days depending on the animal.\n\nFIRST DAY RIBEYE\n\nThe short story is this : Dry aging meat is the traditional way of creating superbly tender meat by letting naturally occurring enzymes slowly tenderize the meat. \xa0\n\n12 Day Ribeye\n\nAssuming the right conditions, it takes between 16 to 21 days for the process to come to fruition. After 21 days, the meat will not get more tender but will with additional time, anything to 70+ days, become more flavorful.\xa0\n\n21 Day Ribeye\n\nGenerally, the longer it ages past 21 days, the more it develops flavor to a more nutty taste. Naturally, it all depends on the type of animal, type of muscle you dry aging, USDA grade, the size of the cut, age and prior welfare of the animal.\xa0\n\n45 DAY RIBEYE\n\nDry aging meat is almost always done in sub primal cuts of meat due to the better yield and tenderness as well as flavor. Sub primal cuts are section of beef that are left on the bone and have the majority of their fat covers still intact.\xa0\n\n\nThis is important as you want this protection over the muscle tissue as over time the controlled air cooled environment will remove moisture from the cut. It also plays a role in the type of cuts you choose. They are generally limited to the rib, short loin and sirloin sub primal cuts.\xa0\nThe reason to leave the bones on the meat is that when it continues to go through the dry aging process it will pull away from the bone. If there are no bones, the \u201cpulling\u201d will result in higher non usable product. It also has the strongest nutty flavor near the bone.\nSAFETY CAUTION\nSome people dry age steaks inside their regular fridge. This is not recommended (in fact, it is illegal in a commercial environment) as the environment in your fridge is not suitable for dry aging. Even popular dry bag short term dry aging can be dangerous. In the main this is due to the high humidity and highly fluctuating temperature in your household fridge that promotes bacterial growth which in turn can cause foodbourne illnesses and ruin your meat. In addition to high humidity, it lacks a germicidal inhibitor such a Spectrum UVC lamp.\xa0\n\nUVC Bacterial Light in Steaklocker Fridge\n\nThese lamps are vital to kill bacteria that are present on the meat and inside the fridge. In fact, every feature of our Steaklocker, such as the continuous\xa0fan forced air flow\xa0and constant low temperature are critical to the safe dry aging process. Other devices such as dry aging bags, that promote \xa0short term dry aging, are not safe due to the lack of the above mentioned features. You should not gamble with ecoli and other bacterial based food bourne illnesses.\n__________________________________________________________________\nSo, this is very important, do not put your own safety or that of your friends or family at risk. \xa0\n__________________________________________________________________\n\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0THE TEAM\xa0\n\n\n\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0AN INSPIRATION OF STEAKLOVERS\nIt all started In 2010, Nadia Bruno was the Marketing Manager of the team that built the first steakhouse in the midwest featuring an integrated dry age steak glass display fridge.\xa0Guests were greeted by a rare, artful glimpse into the beef aging process uniquely showcased upon entrance in a dry aged cooling room lined with Himalyan salt blocks intended to intensify beef flavors.\n\nOur most admired midwest steakhouse\n\nIntegrating the display fridge into the overall design of the restaurant was as a novel way to bring the pride of the chefs visually closer to the guests.

You can purchase Choice or Prime sub primal cuts from your favorite butcher for say $10.00 to $14.00 per pound. Savings of at least 50%\xa0\n\n\nIn the past, you were not able to professionally and safely dry age your own steaks. Until NOW, we bring a \xa0brand new perspective to\xa0your home (or even small commercial property) grilling with the best dry aged steaks completely under your control.\xa0Now the joy of grilling your own dry age steaks is a reality with this truly unique home dry age steaklocker.\nThat's how easy it is...\nStep one: \xa0buy your favorite sub primal cut from your favorite butcher. Best results are assured with bone-in sub primal like Ribeye and Sirloin or a combination of those two.\n\n\nStep two: place it in the fridge.\nThat's it. Let it rest (dry age) for at least 21 days or longer depending on your desired flavor profile, then cut yourself your own individual steaks.\n\n\nMODERN TECHNOLOGY PAIRED WITH OLD WORLD TECHNIQUES\nSteaklocker's first production line run is offered in a standard 34 inch cabinet size.\n\n\nSteaklocker is developing \xa0a state of the art digital hygrometer controller (patent pending)\xa0allowing you to adjust the recommended settings to vary the flavor and tenderness of the meat.\xa0\nWe are developing our own smart phone app (IOS & if stretch goal achieved, Android) specifically for the dry age fridge. The primary application is the real-time digital sensor and controller (patent pending)\xa0that provides you with instant feedback on the critical temperature\xa0and humidity operations of the fridge. Until now, only the absolute high end humidors and fridges were able to control humidity inside the fridge. This equipment would cost anything from $ 5,000 up. Our (patent pending) modular digital\xa0hygrometer controller will use modern I-technology to achieve this.\n\nIMP Sensor Schematic\n\nThis sensor is bluetooth enabled and once linked up through the IMP sensor system, integrates seamlessly into Steaklocker's own smart app. This allows you to\xa0connect in seconds using just your smartphone.\xa0\n\n\nThis feature will alert your smart-phone when preset values are exceeded. This nifty element will ensure you won't loose your dry age product investment if power failures or other emergencies occur.\n\nSteaklocker Smart App (IOS)\n\nAdditional smart app features such as provenance information, complete step by step dry aging operational instructions, nutritional and caloric information for major recipes, top 100 dry age beef supplying farms\xa0and\xa0top 100 best steakhouses\xa0will all be available to ensure you have the very best Steaklocker experience. A 1-800 rapid customer service help number will also be provided.\nSOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT KIT (SDK)\nSteaklocker's smart app is planning to be as open as possible. It generates streams of data that can be used or stored and applied in many different ways. We will develop more connected speciality refrigeration and other devices for niche markets. In order to take advantage of the talent out in the market, we want to enable suitably interested people to develop software and hardware solutions that will work with as many\xa0device\xa0as possible. We're hoping to create an ecosystem of connected useful and practical culinary devices - that's why we\u2019re making our SDK available to dedicated parties.\n\nSteaklocker SmartApp (IOS)\n\nNew development option such as a live optic feed, sensor driven grilling thermometers and many other features are in development and are estimated for release in future months.\nOther Design Features\nWe have designed our dry age fridge based on our commercial success with steakhouse dry age environments. We have designed a unique modular hygrometer controller (patent pending) that is completely independent of the internal display sensor to ensure that internal humidity is achieved at optimal levels. Another first in dry aging technology.\n\nLatest Modular Humidity Controller\n\nSteaklocker has other optional features such as Himalayan Salt Blocks and\xa0Special Herb and Spice Silk Pouches that deliver additional flavor, taste and intensify the natural beef aroma.\xa0\n\n250m years in the making - Himalyan Salt Blocks\n\nBeautiful designs includes a sleek UV resistant stainless steel, UV protected tempered glass door and modern luxurious chrome handle bars.\xa0\n\n\nThe inside is enveloped with food grade black embossed aluminum with 2 removable extending chrome shelves for the dry age product. Hanging the cuts from the upper shelf is also possible with this design.\n\n\nSteaklocker's aesthetics are designed to co-ordinate with all of your other appliances or can be installed as an eye catching display case in your kitchen or courtyard BBQ area.\n\n\nTechnical Specifications:\n750 BTU powerful compressor\nFan Forced air flow\nPrecise Temperature range - 33F to 68F\nSmart Application Sensor Control - Bluetooth enabled\nFiberglass/Metal exterior with embossed black aluminum interior\n2 pane glass UV protected stainless steel door\nDigital temperature and humidity display\nActive carbon odor filter (replaceable)\nStandard Cabinet Size\n2 full extension adjustable and removable chrome wire shelves\n65 lbs. dry aging product capacity\nInterior germicidal sterilization lamps\nSelf closing door with lock\n37dba sound rating\nWhat is Dry Aging\nDry aging does for red meat what cave aging does for cheese or cellaring for Bordeaux \u2013 it\xa0improves the taste greatly with time. In addition, it will tenderize the meat after approximately 18 - 21 days depending on the animal.\n\nFIRST DAY RIBEYE\n\nThe short story is this : Dry aging meat is the traditional way of creating superbly tender meat by letting naturally occurring enzymes slowly tenderize the meat. \xa0\n\n12 Day Ribeye\n\nAssuming the right conditions, it takes between 16 to 21 days for the process to come to fruition. After 21 days, the meat will not get more tender but will with additional time, anything to 70+ days, become more flavorful.\xa0\n\n21 Day Ribeye\n\nGenerally, the longer it ages past 21 days, the more it develops flavor to a more nutty taste. Naturally, it all depends on the type of animal, type of muscle you dry aging, USDA grade, the size of the cut, age and prior welfare of the animal.\xa0\n\n45 DAY RIBEYE\n\nDry aging meat is almost always done in sub primal cuts of meat due to the better yield and tenderness as well as flavor. Sub primal cuts are section of beef that are left on the bone and have the majority of their fat covers still intact.\xa0\n\n\nThis is important as you want this protection over the muscle tissue as over time the controlled air cooled environment will remove moisture from the cut. It also plays a role in the type of cuts you choose. They are generally limited to the rib, short loin and sirloin sub primal cuts.\xa0\nThe reason to leave the bones on the meat is that when it continues to go through the dry aging process it will pull away from the bone. If there are no bones, the \u201cpulling\u201d will result in higher non usable product. It also has the strongest nutty flavor near the bone.\nSAFETY CAUTION\nSome people dry age steaks inside their regular fridge. This is not recommended (in fact, it is illegal in a commercial environment) as the environment in your fridge is not suitable for dry aging. Even popular dry bag short term dry aging can be dangerous. In the main this is due to the high humidity and highly fluctuating temperature in your household fridge that promotes bacterial growth which in turn can cause foodbourne illnesses and ruin your meat. In addition to high humidity, it lacks a germicidal inhibitor such a Spectrum UVC lamp.\xa0\n\nUVC Bacterial Light in Steaklocker Fridge\n\nThese lamps are vital to kill bacteria that are present on the meat and inside the fridge. In fact, every feature of our Steaklocker, such as the continuous\xa0fan forced air flow\xa0and constant low temperature are critical to the safe dry aging process.

u'\nIn 1971, Hunter S. Thompson rampaged through Las Vegas searching for the American Dream in a continuous state of drug-addled madness.  The absurdity of this premise along with Thompson\'s claim to be a "monstrous reincarnation of Horatio Alger" are what make Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas such a depraved and entertaining adventure. \n\n\nFor most people, Las Vegas is the dystopian antithesis of everything Horatio Alger had in mind in the mid-19th century when he wrote rags-to-riches American stories that hinged on integrity, perseverance, and a little luck.  Today, if you had a son who told you he was moving to Las Vegas to seek fame and fortune, you would probably cringe, and if you had a daughter who told you she was moving there to seek fame and fortune, you would probably cry. At least these were my thoughts as I read the recent Wired magazine story about Tony Hsieh, CEO of Zappos.com, and his Downtown Project - http://www.wired.com/2014/01/zappos-tony-hsieh-las-vegas/. For those who don\'t know, downtown Las Vegas was the original hot spot for debaucherous fun before it migrated out to the Strip beginning in the 40s.  There have been efforts over the past decade to rejuvenate a small 4 block stretch of the old casinos, but until just recently most tourists were told to simply avoid the area after dark.  And yet, this is the milieu into which Tony Hsieh has chosen to plow $350,000,000 of his own money to create an "entrepreneurial tech nirvana," anchored by a genuine community of intelligent, conscientious, and real people. It is natural to feel skeptical when hearing about this grand social experiment for the first time.  My numerous personal experiences in Las Vegas have inclined me to think of it more as the unrestrained outlet of human nature that Hunter S. Thompson sensationalized - a giant neon oasis filled with crazy buildings, unnatural lights and sounds, surgically enhanced women, and free booze; all designed to appeal to our animal desires and trigger an explosion of irresponsible, reckless, and financially draining behavior. But I was fascinated by the possibilities of propping up a modern startup culture against this backdrop of loosely controlled insanity, so I read Mr. Hsieh\'s book, Delivering Happiness.  A partial autobiography and history of Zappos.com, the book\'s primary focus is on the culture and community of the Zappos workplace and the dedication of the management to measure success not only in terms of financial profits, but also in terms of customer, vendor, and employee satisfaction.  Mr. Hsieh believes that the purpose of wealth is not to build giant offices and mansions with locked doors and gated fences to insulate you from the world around you, but to use it as a tool of social enrichment that helps facilitate the kinds of personal interactions that underly a large part of human happiness. \n\n\nIn a famous passage from Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Hunter S. Thompson reflects on the spirit of the San Francisco counter-culture movement in the 1960s and says, "We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave... So now, less than five years later, you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look West, and with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high-water mark \u2014 that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back." Perhaps the wave of optimism and hope in the 1960s did break and roll back to its source in the Bay Area, but perhaps a new wave is rolling out from Silicon Valley.  Perhaps the lessons of the 60s were actually digested by the mainstream, with the most nutritious parts being absorbed into the lifeblood of corporate America.  Perhaps hippie has bred with yuppie to create a new breed of optimistic, passionate entrepreneur who knows that for any social movement to be sustainable over the long term it must be fueled by more than love and good music, it must be cash positive and have a healthy line of credit.  And perhaps Mr. Hsieh has the right kind of eyes to see the possibility of a thriving, progressive entrepreneurial culture taking root in Downtown Las Vegas.This blog will chronicle my experience joining the Downtown \'movement.\'  I have an old website I put together in high school that still gets a significant amount of web traffic - www.shotgunrules.com.  I don\'t make any money with it right now, but with a little help from the right people, it has some potential.  So I\'m heading to Vegas to see what kind of people I meet and to try and monetize my website, and to report on what I find.  A modern day gonzo journalism adventure - a sober journey to redeem the American dream. \n\n\nhttp://purehoratioalger.blogspot.com/2014/06/a-sober-journey-to-redeem-american-dream.htmlAt the end of summer, if the journalism experiment is successful, I will edit the blog posts and weave them into a 50,000 word eBook.\n'
Current:
u"\nA lot of headlines have been written recently about the death of the American Dream.  Chronic unemployment, a widening gap between rich and poor, and the rapid changes brought on by new technologies have all helped create uncertainty and angst about the future.  As a result, many people no longer believe a clear path exists in America that will afford them upward social mobility and empower their hopes and dreams.  The Main Nerve is a new gonzo journalism project being conducted by Thomas Reuter, a journalist from Colorado who has relocated to Downtown Las Vegas Nevada in order to start a technology company and paint a picture of modern startup culture and the opportunities this culture offers to a new generation.  \r\n\n\nJuxtaposing themes from Hunter S. Thompson\u2019s classic Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas to highlight the opposite nature of his own journey, The Main Nerve chronicles Mr. Reuter\u2019s attempt to take advantage of the infrastructure being created by the Las Vegas 'Downtown Project' to learn about crowdfunding and succeed in business in a way that reaffirms the American Dream and illustrates a new path for others to achieve this dream themselves.Mr. Reuter says he was inspired to undertake this project by past setbacks in pursuing his own dream. \u201cI made the mistake of buying a newspaper in 2008, and after that experience I decided I had better embrace new technology if I didn\u2019t want to find myself on the losing side of it again.\u201dMr. Reuter\u2019s first attempt at exploring the ins and outs of crowdfunding is the first gonzo journalism Kickstarter project approved under Kickstarter\u2019s new \u2018Journalism\u2019 category.   The goal of this project is a modest $750, 33% of which was achieved by the 4th day of the project launch.  The project is slated to wrap up on the 4th of July, a symbolic completion date that underscores the goals Mr. Reuter hopes to achieve. Please direct press inquiries to thomaswreuter@gmail.com. \n\n\nhttp://purehoratioalger.blogspot.com/2014/06/a-sober-journey-to-redeem-american-dream.htmlIf this journalism project is funded, Mr. Reuter will edit the blog posts at the end of summer and weave them into a 50,000 word eBook.\n"

u"\nIn April of 2014, I launched a beta version of a website called The Actors Catalogue, accessible at www.theactorscatalogue.com.\xa0The Actors Catalogue is a student-made website designed exclusively for NYU Tisch students to find actors, be noticed, make connections, and get casting. Film\xa0and photography majors who are looking for actors for their projects may use the site to find the type they're looking for.The instructions are simple: scroll through our growing list of over 100 student actors, find the faces that intrigue you, and click for their contact information. It couldn't be easier.In the month and a half between its release and the end of the school year, The Actors Catalogue met tremendous success. As of today, 115 Tisch actors are listed.The 2014-2015 school year will be the site's first full year, and The Actors Catalogue is ready to be your one-stop casting resource.Why we need you: this fall, The Actors Catalogue is moving to a new online home, which will accommodate its growing audience and will be a better host for all the new features the site will have to offer. This means money, unfortunately \u2014 between paying for the domain, the host, troubleshooting, and upkeep, there's some cash needed in order to keep things running. If it's just me paying, it's pretty expensive. If everyone chips in, it's hardly a dent.This site is still in its baby form, but it has shown promise of turning into something that will truly redefine the way arts students create their projects. Your donations will make this endeavor possible.The Actors Catalogue is not affiliated with or endorsed by NYU or Tisch School of the Arts.\xa0\n"

u"\nUPDATE:\xa0WOAH! We've almost doubled our goal! Amazing! Thank you so, so much!The original goal of $400 accommodates some of the price of legal stuff (hello, Actors Catalogue, Inc.!), some advertising, and moving the site from Tumblr to Wix. With your support, we can do so much more.STRETCH GOALS:$900: Hire a computer programmer! Because let's face it, my self-taught HTML knowledge will only get us so far. This means we won't need Wix and will be able to make a much more unique site.$1100: OMG! A better programmer! Who likes pretty websites? I do. You do too.$1500: Launch party? Launch party.$1600: Financial stability.$2000: Launch party with clowns/balloon animals, even better programmer, snacks.$2500: Jake will produce a film featuring every member of The Actors Catalogue. Maybe.________________________________________________My name is Erica Pappas and I am an acting student at New York University\u2019s Tisch School of the Arts.NYU has world-class programs for both acting and film, but for a school so adamant about fostering collaboration, it hardly offers bridges to close the gap between these two departments that are entirely codependent on one another. That is, NYU doesn\u2019t offer much means of introducing film and acting students to each other.So in April, I created The Actors Catalogue, accessible at www.theactorscatalogue.com. The idea is simple: Tisch actors send me their head shots and resumes to be listed on the site. Then, film students who need to cast their projects log onto the site, scroll through the headshots of hundreds of Tisch acting students, click on the photos of the actors that interest them, and can receive contact information. From there, an artistic project is ready to be made.I launched the beta version of The Actors Catalogue in April, and it has met tremendous success far larger than I'd imagined. Its audience has grown exponentially and word of the casting resource has buzzed through NYU Tisch. All four class years and all six acting studios are represented on the site, and site traffic passes a hundred hits every day.Right now, The Actors Catalogue is being moved to a more self-sufficient webhost with brand new design, organization, privacy features, and a beautiful new interface. The improvements will help hundreds of acting and film students get the experience they need to make a serious splash in the professional industry. The Actors Catalogue is totally free for users, but hosting a web domain is not. There\u2019s no money flowing in, out, or around the project. This Kickstarter is its first shot at generating some cash to make the upgrade and upkeep possible. Please, if you have interest in art or art schools, consider making a donation or sharing. I run The Actors Catalogue, Inc. completely on my own, and I am very passionate about its growth and success. Your donations make a world of a difference. Together, we\u2019re going to redefine the way art schools approach collaboration.The Actors Catalogue, Inc. is not affiliated with or endorsed by NYU or Tisch School of the Arts.\xa0\n"

After a while, everyone wanted more tiny bowls. Some filed them with spices, kept their rings safe, hostess gifts, a taster for Whiskey, or just filed with love. These tiny bowls have brought so much joy for my friends and family.\xa0\n\n\nInstead of a pet rock have a pet \xa0"Tiny Bowl". These bowls are food-safe and dishwasher-safe. Just be careful you do not lose them in the dishwasher.Each bowl is hand-sculpted with clay by me and then fired in a Kiln. Then painted and fired one more time in the Kiln.

u"\nThe Sounds of Christmastime. That conjures many different memories to different people, but each year when the air gets a bit colder and the season gets a bit jollier, the Atlanta Vocal Project spreads the essence of Christmastime sounds by performing your favorite holiday songs with a quality and fun that is among the best in the Southeast. It\u2019s been a while since we captured that essence in the form of a CD, and we feel our continued improvement, growth, and new repertoire makes this the perfect time to record a second studio album to let our fans take home that unique AVP Christmas sound.\nUnder the direction of Clay Hine, Atlanta Vocal Project is Atlanta's best men\u2019s a cappella chorus specializing in the barbershop style. Our vision is to enrich lives in every generation in our surrounding communities through performances, music education, school system programs, and community activities through the lifelong benefits of a cappella harmony singing and performances.\nThis CD project is the next step toward achieving that vision, but we can\u2019t do it alone. Help us to enrich lives by donating to our Kickstarter campaign. The funds you raise will help cover the costs of professional recording studio sessions, high-quality post production mastering, licensing fees, and physical materials to release a finished product you and your family will enjoy for many years.\nWe have already begun recording ten new holiday tunes, some our fans have heard in recent Christmas concerts, and others being performed for the first time this year! Selections include fun, jazzy versions of Christmas classics like Jingle Bells and Santa Baby, beautifully stirring songs like Away in a Manger and White Christmas, and of course our unique, crowd-favorite rendition of the Nutcracker Suite as only AVP can pull off (or get away with)! We\u2019re lucky to have a director who is also a world class arranger, and as most of our charts are his craftsmanship, we bring top-notch a cappella music to the public year after year.Our goal is to have this new CD ready by early December so it can be ready to be enjoyed by all our fans for the holiday season and spread to as much of the community as possible. It has been an aggressive schedule, but so far our singers have done a fantastic job learning and perfecting these great songs, and we are truly proud of the product that is coming your way soon. If the project goes well, we are even considering a second CD to be recorded this spring to bring some of our other repertoire to you! If we receive enough funding here above our goal, your contribution will then go toward making that second CD a reality.\nSo don\u2019t miss out on this opportunity. Be a part of our vision for an a cappella Christmas!\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\u201cAVP is the single most stunning group that we have ever had perform with the LSO in the past 14 years! Clay Hine is an absolute musical genius and the acting and choreography was sensational!\u201d \u2013 A quote from Thomas Ludwig, Musical Director of the Ludwig Symphony OrchestraRewards\nJust in case you need more motivation to contribute than knowing you helped produce a quality Christmas album of an amazing chorus, we have a number of exciting rewards to thank you for your help at different donation levels.\xa0\nAt $10, you can be the first to download a finished track from the new CD!\xa0\nAt $25, you can be the first to download the whole album! Why wait for those pesky printers!?\xa0\nAt $50, you\u2019ll receive a physical copy of the CD signed by our director, Clay Hine. Thankfully, NCAA rules do not prohibit this. Who knows how much that autograph will be worth one day!\xa0\nAt $100, you\u2019ll get the signed CD, plus two Premium tickets to our Christmas show on December 20th, 2014. There\u2019s nothing quite like hearing us live, and this package is a great value while knowing you helped make it all possible.\xa0\nAt $250, you can sponsor a song on the CD with a sponsor credit on the CD jacket track list.

u'\nWhy can\u2019t photography training videos be more entertaining? Why are they all shot in a studio? I don\u2019t have a studio, do you?I can\u2019t relate, I shoot everything on location.\xa0\n\n\nA while back I joined up with Mark Behrens the founder of the Lighting Asylum and he began to teach me photography. I quickly met other photographers; it\u2019s not hard 1 out of every 4 friends on Facebook claims to be a photographer!\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\nWhat I noticed is that everyone had excuses for average work, \u201cI only shoot natural light\u201d, \u201cmy equipment is not good enough\u201d, or \u201cthe lighting is not good today\u201d\u2026\xa0\n\n\nWhat I found out is that most people calling themselves photographers just never had anyone really explain lighting to them before, at least in a way that made sense.\xa0\nWe have been shooting this tutorial for almost a year now, in between jobs, family commitments and has been 100% funded at this point out of our own pockets.\xa0\n\n\n\xa0This is where you come in, we need to master the video and have the physical copies printed and the cost of this will halt the release date for months as we save up these funds. This kickstarter will allow us to move this date up to November of this year!\xa0\nDo you have anything that you are really passionate about? You know \u2026something that you just cannot not stop thinking about; something that frequently wakes you up in the middle of the night?\xa0\nWell, Photography is that for me!\xa0\n\nLance Briggs, #55 Chicago Bears\n\nI\u2019ve found the answer! It seemed crazy at first. Why not take the mountain to Mohamed?\nHow could I do that? By taking everything that I have learned about flash and putting it all into a video. So crazy was the idea, that after almost 12 months of work putting it all together, it\u2019s almost here\u2026\xa0\nPlease help us cross the finish line!\xa0\nThank you,\n\xa0Corbin Maki and the Lighting Asylum team\n'

u'\nWhy does learning have to be so challenging, dry, and matter-of-fact?Why can\u2019t it be fun, enjoyable, and entertaining?.We asked ourselves these questions\u2014as they relate to photography, and specifically correct lighting in photography\u2014several years ago.  The answer was our original DVD, The Lighting Asylum.  We launched the program on Kickstarter where we were able to secure the funds necessary to create a professionally produced DVD.\xa0.\nThe Lighting Asylum was a rousing success, watched by thousands of photographers in over 40 countries!  Thank you to each and every one of you who purchased the DVD.\nBut it doesn\u2019t end there\u2026\n\n\n\nWith the success of The Lighting Asylum we have been introduced to many new methods and techniques which have served to enhance our original program, and have formed the basis for our newest video, \u201cUnderstanding Flash,\u201d a practical, and entertaining, tutorial on flash photography.\nThe new video features Corbin Maki, an attractive and talented young photographer who presents everything you need to know about flash photography!  \u2026Well, at least enough to start an addiction to artificial lighting.  \nYou will absolutely love the way Corbin presents all the elements of flash photography in an engaging, amusing, and enjoyable manner!\n\n\n\xa0As you can imagine, shooting, editing, and producing a professional quality DVD is very expensive.  To help complete our newest video, and make it available as soon as possible, we have launched a Kickstarter campaign.  As a photographer, your contribution to this campaign will ensure the video is completed in the next few months, which we know will benefit the entire photographic community.\nSo please join us in making this a rousing success.  Your contribution of any amount will guarantee the completion of the DVD \u2026and you will be eligible for a 30% discount as soon as the DVD is ready.Don\u2019t wait, help us complete the campaign and get this helpful and entertaining video \u201cin the can.\u201d   \n\n\nThank you for your valued support,\n\n\n\xa0Corbin Maki and the Lighting Asylum team\n\n'

u"\n\nTweet about the Dickstarter!\n\nhttps://twitter.com/TheDickstarterWHAT?I just graduated college and I have no job. Let's bring it back to the goals of my youth. I want to make the world's biggest dick drawing. With your help, I will be able to create a wonderful (and long) drawing of the male anatomy. This is both a personal project rooted in my childhood dreams, as well as a collaborate project to spread awareness and understanding of our bodies. We didn't grow up drawing dicks out of nowhere. It was fun, it was funny. It's still fun and it's still funny. Whether it is a terrible sketch on a bar napkin or a beautiful painting on a canvas; a dick drawing is a dick drawing. Seeing an abstract dick by Picasso in a museum is just as funny as drawing one for yourself in the condensation of a car window. Let's impress Guinness with the World's Biggest Dick Drawing. Project WBDD is officially on the rise!HOW?The pledges for this art project will directly dictate the outcome of the dick drawing. Every dollar will add an inch to the drawing. The inches will be accumulated and drawn on high quality paper, then the paper will be spread out to form the dick drawing. This forming of the dick drawing will most likely take place outside wherever a large surface area is available. The goal is set at 100 inches (which would probably be a record breaking dick drawing) but I will draw this thing as many inches as the pledges expect me to. Every pledge will have their name attributed to their inch and all pledges will be listed in a huge thank you letter. Let's see who is willing to make this drawing erect to massive proportions!WHY?It's everyone's dream to see a huge dick drawing. For scientific purposes or otherwise.ANYTHING ELSE?Once funding is complete the entire dick drawing project will be documented and hopefully DVDs can be made to thank everyone on video, and so you and your kids can someday watch the history you helped make!If the dick drawing is successful enough, we can probably get some sort of recognition from Guinness (hopefully a plaque with a dick engraving).***INCENTIVES*** Dickstarter Promo Shirt: *Adds five inches to drawing* (only five available)\n\n\nDickstarter Private's Shirt: *Adds five inches to drawing* (only thirty available)\n\n\nDickstarter General's Shirt: *Adds ten inches to drawing* (only thirty available)\n\n\nSEND IN YOUR OWN DICK DRAWINGS!I'm accepting everyone's own personal dick drawings (for another project in the future or after the Dickstarter has ended) and would love if you submitted yours! The rules about these submissions can be found here or under the update page. Submissions can be sent to dickstartersubmission@gmail.com\xa0background music composed by Kase Closed (KaseClosed206)\n"
