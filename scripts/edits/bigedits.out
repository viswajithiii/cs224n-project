u'\nThis is the Absolutely Nothing At All campaign. Take a reading.\n\n\nThe potato salad, the combat kitchenware, the chicken burrito.\xa0These are just a few of the Kickstarter campaigns that people funded. So this made me ask:"What are people willing to pay for?". This may sound stupid, but keep in mind that money doesn\'t have a pre-set value. You could see a 5 dollar note as something that takes up space in your wallet, I could see a 5 dollar note as the only way to get a meal.So, ask yourself:"How much am I willing to spend on absolutely nothing at all?". Is it 1\xa3? A fiver? Is it nothing? Or an amazing 500\xa3?\xa0This is a study to explore the human mind, the sociological and psychological implications that lie behind money, and what money itself is worth.\xa0What am I going to do with the money, if the project is successful?I would like to write a book based on the whole experience, explaining in detail all the reasons that lie behind this campaign, a book about the power of the Internet, that can gather people from around the world who decide to help others fulfill their dreams. And my dream is to create something huge from this little project who basically involves pure and unconditional philanthropy. And an enormous amount of trust.So, if you never asked yourself these questions...well maybe now it\'s the right time.If successful, I will base my Computer Engineering graduation thesis on this. I encourage you to check my profile description to learn a little bit more about me.Luca\n\n\n'

Damn it guys this thing is sailing! :D*********************************************************************This is the Absolutely Nothing At All campaign.\xa0\n\n\nYes, so, basically I'm trying to see if anyone is willing to give money for free.\xa0It's like art, more or less, it's pointless but it's gonna make you feel stuff. Like anger or passion or largesse. Maybe largesse.Anyone?Luca\n\n\n"

u"\nPeople posing as statues is not new and is a common sight among buskers.\xa0 I admire their courage, but seldom the execution. \xa0 Fooling the human eye is a difficult challenge. But, is it even possible to be that convincing?An artist, not a busker, my intention is the exact opposite Approaching this as an artist, the idea became a challenge to combine physical and mental focus with artistic detail\xa0 to see if I could go unrecognized as the artist, even posing in a public place.To compliment the western culture here in Arizona I decided an iconic cowboy immortalized in bronze would be most appropriate.\xa0 And the popular tourist trap of Old Town Scottsdale, Arizona would be the setting for the experiment.Well after much trial and error,\xa0 I mastered every aspect to each detail. Imagine the people's reactions to a statue suddenly coming to life!\xa0 \xa0\xa0 The moment of reveal is unforgettable and capturing them my goal. This art REALLY is unforgettable!This art happens!\xa0  Only I intend to capture every performance on film and create a documentary to chronicle every hilarious moment.Worthwhile?\xa0 Consider how often does this happen? never?\xa0 Maybe on TV, or candid camera, but not to an average person on an ordinary day.Well, it does! I believe making people happy is a worthwhile return for my endeavor.Giving time, effort and whatever else is a worth the sacrifice to make\xa0 an unforgettable memory possible for someone.The result:\xa0 A thrilling film of real 'once in a lifetime' moments that will have you laughing out loud.Capturing on film each hilarious moment is the goal.\xa0 Unfortunately, the camera was recently stolen.\xa0 Kick Starter is the opportunity\xa0 to replace the camera with a better camera(s) to improve the movie and sound quality.Please visit me at bronzecowboy.com, or watch me on YouTube etc.\xa0 I want to clarify my intention is artistic, I am not a busker.\xa0\xa0 I never call attention to myself or reveal the illusion unless disturbed .I have no intention to scare the %#@! out of anyone, (Sometimes it happens). but\xa0 I\xa0 do not pounce or grab or move in anyway, unless I am disturbed first.Please visit my website bronzecowboy.com and see for yourself!Thank you \n"

u'\nThe KS project will produce a quality, one of a kind film revealing the many different ways people react as they unknowingly come face to face with an illusion.\xa0 \xa0\xa0\n\nArt Happens only when it reaches into and twists reality.A visit to bronzecowboy.com, will allow you to see the concept in action.\xa0 I want to clarify\xa0 I am not a busker. My intention is artistic.\xa0 The method is sinister,\xa0 but sadistic, I never intentionally scare anyone, (though it happens). I\xa0 never move or make a sound,\xa0 unless I am disturbed first!Kick Starter will enable improved video and sound quality in the finished production and an additional camera angle.Consisting of once in a lifetime moments that will make you laugh and cry, the entertainment value of the content will be immeasurable.Thank you \n\n'

u'\nTime to Stretch Goals!\nWe\'re funded !! Thank you very much for all your support. Now it is time to stretch goals.Ambient Light Sensor\xa0- \xa345,000(Almost Reached!)\xa0We\'ll add an ambient light sensor in the controller circuit.The sensor will measure the light conditions in the room and change the LED strip light level automatically. It will be optional mode in the driver software.Ambient Light + Color Sensor\xa0-\xa0\xa360,000\xa0We\'ll add a RGB color sensor in the controller circuit. This sensor can measure the full visible spectrum light levels and helps you to calibrate your monitor or correct the LED strip colors under colored room lights.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\xa0What is AmbliLED HD?\xa0 \xa0AmbiLED HD is the first high resolution ambient light conversation kit for computer monitors.We started out designing it as just an open source fun project, but after our prototype generated a large amount of interest,we have decided to offer this as a commercial product.\xa0\xa0 Common commercial and DIY ambient light systems use 3-30 LEDs around the display. This is because every individual RGB LED requires 3 pins to control the colours. This means a lot of cables and connectors between LEDs and controller.\xa0\n\n\n\xa0 Thanks to new generation individually addressable WS2812B 16 million colours RGB LEDs, there is no longer a need for complex cabling and connections. Here is the back of our test monitor that you can see on the Kickstarter video. We applied a 290cm long strip with 172 LEDs. There is no cabling or construction behind the monitor.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\xa0      AmbiLED HD can control up to 512 LEDs(8.5 meters) with just a 3 pin connection, and works as a single self-adhesive LED strip without any extra cabling. Just attach the strip to the back of your display, plug the 3 pin connector into the AmbiLED HD controller, supply the controller with AC adapter (included) and connect it to USB port of your PC.That\'s all you need to enjoy AmbiLED HD.\n\n\n\n\nHow does it work?\xa0 The human eye has a very limited area of approximately 6\xb0\xa0where objects appear clear and sharp, but our visual field is 120\xb0\xa0wide. When you are watching a movie or playing a game you can only clearly see the spot your eyes are focused on, but you can sense the whole 120\xb0\xa0area, including frame and background.\xa0\xa0 AmbiLED HD paints the background with the nearest colour and improves your visual experience. It also reduces your pupil size with extra light, and protects your eyes in the darkness.\n\n\n\n\nVisual Experience\xa0 \xa0It can be startling at first when you see a part of lightsaber or a blast effect beyond the boundaries of the screen.\xa0\xa0 If a car crosses the display fast enough, you will find yourself trying to follow it on the wall. After learns and adjusts to the screen limits, and you simply become immersed in the experience.\n\n\n\n\nHow can I install?\xa0\xa0Installation of AmbiLED HD is very simple and takes only 3-5 minutes depending on your screen size. The self-adhesive RGB LED strip is only 12mm wide, and is flexible and bendable. You can stick it to the sides of your monitor and bend it on the edges easily. The adhesive material on the strip is good quality and reusable. You can remove it and transfer the strip to another monitor.\n\n\n\xa0 There is no need to cut any unused part of the strip. Our AmbiLED HD driver software comes with a simple setup menu. Just count your LEDs that are used for your setup, and adjust the settings accordingly. It will disable any unused LEDs automatically. \xa0\n\xa0\xa0For the videos, we used a 37" Samsung LCD TV. The perimeter of this display was 290cm, and LED count was 172. After we entered this number into the AmbiLED software, it disabled the last 10cm of LED strip.You can simply bend this 10cm section to the back of your display, so that you can use it with a larger monitor in the future, or cut the excess off with a scissor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHardware Features\nOpen Source Hardware, Firmware & Software\nWindows,Linux & Mac compatible Arduino based hardware design\nFlexible & Bendable 12mm wide self adhesive RGB LED Strip\n14W/m powerful RGB LEDs (only 3W/m enough for AmbiLED HD)\n5V 3000mA wall adapter (capable of supplying up to 5 meters of LED strip)\nUK,EU or US wall adapter plugs depending on your location.\n3 meters flat USB Micro cable\non Windows\nAmbiLED HD orginally designed for Windows and using own software under Windows platform.Driver Software Features\nWindows compatible easy to use driver software\nSleep Mode Function\nBorderless Window Configurator(Pseudo Full Screen) for games.\nUser configurable light level.\nMicrosoft C# + DirectX based software design\nCapturing images directly from front buffer*\nWorks with all Windows applications except full screen games*.\xa0(*)Capturing from back buffer is the ban reason for most of game companies.

u"\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\nThis new foodconcept is an extension of my already existing and fruitful business Barrykookt.nl, which I run for six years already. I conduct my business from home. I've developed myself from being a well organised and very tasteful home cook, to cooking for larger gatherings of people on location. I am up for weddings, and other bigger events too.I am eager to extend my business with this new concept, because my passion for food has proven to be my unique talent. I would very much like to be able to exploit my own place, where I can receive and treat my guests in my own way. You can be sure I will deliver them an experience of feeling at home, serving them healthy and nutricious meals that are prepared with tender loving care. Served with fine wines. I also serve fresh fruit juices and ground coffee. All of the ingredients that I use are from mostly local, and definitely biological farmers. Visitors can buy them on location or online. Always fresh and tasty, high quality food.I would very much like my clientele to just walk in from time to time, for a chat and the feeling we are neighbours enjoying eachother's talents and expertise.\xa0Also you, can take away soups and complete meals, reserved per portion online. Or join my theme evenings. They are varied in nature and tone: literature, music, food of the season, games/quizzes, singles, dinnerdates, and what not. The interior of my future location will be adjusted to the theme, and the secondhand items exhibited and used there are also for sale. The location will also be used for cooking lessons and workshops. Everything in the building that I want to exploit will be continously changing and challenging, with loads of recycled design stuff and funny things with a twist. Apart from the food I cook, which will be honest and tasty and healthy, I want the place to be vibrant and cosy, feeling like home, but without the sorrows ;-). I intent to be open three days a week.dubbele boeking is t.a.v. Barrykookt.nl op locatie. Ter ondersteuning van dit concept, zie mijn visuele plan om een indruk te krijgen welke sfeer het zal hebben. Het concept is met name een beleving. Mijn product is ook een beleving.\n"

u'\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\nFoodconcept uitbreiding Barrykookt.nl: Inmiddels bestaat Barrykookt.nl ruim 6 jaar. De bedrijfsvoering doe ik vanuit huis. Als \u201cthuiskok\u201d ben ik uitgegroeid tot een kok op locatie ook voor grote groepen en uitgebreide opdrachten. Bruiloften voor 100 personen draai ik mijn hand niet meer voor om. Het nieuwe, vervolgconcept van Barrykookt.nl komt voort uit mijn blijvende passie voor eten en koken. Maar nu ook op een plek waarbij de gasten "Bij Mij" kunnen komen. Om zo de "beleving" van gezond, (h)eerijk, puur en verrassend eten" te kunnen proeven. Eten wat met liefde en aandacht is bereid. Een plek waar je je thuis voelt. Om binnen te komen voor een goede, bijzondere wijn of dat heerlijke vers gemalen kopje koffie, pure theesoorten of een vers fruitsapje. Naast de binnenwandel mogelijkheid, zullen ook de producten te koop zijn. Biologisch, streekgebonden of gewoon bijzonder op zich. Online of in de winkel. Ook voor afhaalmaaltijden en soepen zal de "proeverij Bij Mij" een aantal dagen in de week geopend zijn. Altijd kwaliteit en vers gegarandeerd. In de avonden geopend op reservering. Thema-avonden: Bijvoorbeeld: een literaire avond, een voedsel/seizoensproduct avond, een muzikale avond, een spelavond, een alleengaandenavond, een dinnerdate avond etc. Daarnaast is de ruimte geschikt en geopend voor kooklessen en workshops. Al dan niet gecombineerd. Daarnaast zal het interieur verrassend en "bewegend" zijn. Een "lifemarktplaats". Het interieur is continu te koop. Bijzondere, unieke 2ehands spullen, zoals tafels, stoelen, lampen etc. kun je gewoon kopen. Zo blijft het interieur altijd wijzigen en tot de verbeelding spreken. Daarnaast past het uitstekend in het kader van duurzaamheid en recycling. Nu Barrykookt.nl al 6 jaar bezig is, en een goede naam heeft opgebouwd, wil ik die extra stap gaan zetten. In het pand wat voor bovengenoemde plannen gehuurd/gekocht zal moeten worden, wil ik dan ook heel graag een (voor Sneek) nieuw concept toevoegen. Barrykookt.nl specialiseert zich inmiddels behoorlijk in streek- en seizoens-producten, (h)eerlijke en verrassende gerechten. Biologisch en duurzaam. Ik ben van mening dat er een markt is voor voedzame, eerlijke maaltijden (en soepen). Af te halen in een gezellige ambiance. In eerste instantie zal de \u201cwinkel\u201d voor afhaalmaaltijden/soepen/bezoekjes 3 dagen in de week zijn geopend. Voor thema-avonden, in principe alle avonden mogelijk, zolang dat geen dubbele boeking is t.a.v. Barrykookt.nl op locatie. \xa0Het concept is met name een beleving. Mijn product is ook een beleving.\r\n'

u'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe A Billion Entrepreneurs Foundation ("ABE") is a nonprofit organization that aims to plant the seed of entrepreneurship into generations of people throughout the world.\nWe do this by re-defining the word, \u201centrepreneurship\u201d to mean, \u201cTaking responsibility for outcomes,\u201d which ultimately means taking responsibility of one\u2019s life and current situation. A major catalyst was needed to jump start this movement, and spark people to get inspired to find their purpose in life, with the end result of living happier and more fulfilling lives. Therefore \u201cA Billion Entrepreneurs\u201d The Movie was created.\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\nFILM SYNOPSIS:A Billion Entrepreneurs is an inspiring film about finding your purpose to have more freedom, security and success in your life.In this transformational documentary, I\u2019ve been able to film some incredibly giving individuals, who want nothing more than to see more people experience freedom, security and success for themselves and their families. This film will allow countless people to learn from the examples of those who have traveled this same road, who have made the mistakes, who are willing to pass on valuable knowledge, secrets, and how-tos. In other words, give you a working blueprint to follow. Through their stories, we learn how to apply common principles to our lives, in order to achieve positive outcomes.\n\nABE cast and crew\n\n\nFOX 4Ward: A Billion Entrepreneurs\n\n\xa0I want you to imagine with me\u2026.

u'\nThank you for visiting our Kickstarter.Please help us on our global journey to spread this entrepreneurial spirit throughout the world!We believe that we all have a purpose.  We all have the desire to make a difference.  We are all hardwired for entrepreneurship. There are many people out there, maybe even including you, that feel that way, BUT don\u2019t know where to start or what to do.  You just go through your day, getting lost in the motions.It is very important to embrace entrepreneurship; but of course it isn\u2019t easy.  That is why this movie is being created.  It is the first step on a journey to help create a billion entrepreneurs worldwide.  By having an entrepreneur in every home,  we believe this will have a profound impact on the world and will inspire generations to come.  We plan on reaching our goal of a billion entrepreneurs by redefining the word entrepreneurship to mean \u201ctaking responsibility for outcomes.\u201d  When you take responsibility for outcomes, you are really taking responsibility for the decisions you make based on your purpose in life.  Just imagine how different this world would be if we had one billion people embracing this way of thinking.So in essence, the first step you must do is find your hearts purpose.  When you find your true purpose, life becomes easy.\n\nHow does one find their purpose?We are all born with a unique gift to share with the world.  That is our purpose in life.  We must do the work to first find our purpose and then share that purpose with the world.  It doesn\u2019t mean you have to start a business.  It just means to share your purpose.  Our hearts hold the answer.  Our purpose lies within our heart.  When we uncover that purpose and we start taking responsibility for that purpose, in that moment providence moves, and the magic starts to happen.  When you finally choose your purpose, you will feel a freedom that you have never felt in your life.  With this new found direction, you will have a clear path because all the other options and roadblocks go away. You are now \u201con purpose\u201d.Once you know your purpose, you must act responsibly to manifest that purpose to the world.  As you do so, you will begin to unlock the traits of an entrepreneur.  Once you do that, decision-making will become easier allowing you to achieve more freedom, security and success in your life.  You will officially be on the path of entrepreneurship.\n\nHelp us plant the seed now.  We need your help.This is where we need your help!We need this Kickstarter campaign to reach the minimum so we can continue to inspire entrepreneurship and encourage the global community to find their purpose, which will in return build a better world for all of us.This campaign will allow us to complete the movie.  Once the movie is complete, we will then be able to create tools and resources to assist those on their journey of entrepreneurship.If we don\u2019t reach the minimum, none of the backers will be charged and this film will be put on hold.Perks and BonusesWe want to give everyone a chance to really become a part of this movement of global entrepreneurship.  That is why we decided to offer huge values starting at the $1.00 contribution level.   In addition to being included in the movie and poster campaign, backers can receive a digital copy of the film for a $5.00 contribution.One of the numerous perks to contributing to the kickstarter campaign is to HAVE A PICTURE OF YOUR FACE IN THE FILM AND ON A LIMITED EDITION KICKSTARTER MOVIE POSTER.  We wish we could tell everyone\u2019s story, but we only have 90 minutes for the film.  By giving everyone the opportunity to have their face be part of this project, we are allowing the global community to share their story too.When you purchase the $40 DVD, you will receive over 6 hours of additional footage, including full cast interviews, behind-the-scenes footage, and special guest interviews.If you ask us, the NO-BRAINER LEVEL is the best level to get.  As an entrepreneur, you get to talk directly to the director about the filmmaking process, fundraising initiatives, or marketing tactics to help you plan your own endeavors.  Hear first hand from the guy in the pitt.Why is this film being made?The purpose of this film and project is to deliver a life changing message to people from all walks of life;  you can overcome obstacles, you can take control of your destiny and you can create a better future.  The film addresses situations that every-day people go through when striving for a better life for themselves and those dear to them.  We want people to realize that they are the CEO of themselves and they have the power to make a choice and change the world.  Why are we on Kickstarter?Using a platform like Kickstarter really allows us the opportunity to not only raise funds, but to validate the idea that  people want to take action, find their purpose, and live the life they were meant to live.  Kickstarter will allow us to connect with the people who truly want to see an entrepreneur in every home around the world.Why should I join the cause?You should join this cause only if you are tired of living a life that seems to run around in circles and you see no true results in your life.  They say the two best times to plant a tree is 20 years ago and today.  If you want to get more out of life and become the \u201cCEO" of you, you should join the movement.  You should also join the cause if you are someone who truly cares about spreading the seed of entrepreneurship in your inner circle and your community.What\u2019s the big picture.We realize that we can\'t reach a billion entrepreneurs with just a film alone. We recently created the A Billion Entrepreneurs Foundation to continue the process to see an entrepreneur in every home. We are currently creating relationships with organizations that align with our mission on entrepreneurship. Our primary objective is to provide grants to those aligning organizations to continue serving the entrepreneurial community with resources and programs. Later down the line, we may decide to develop and offer programs that help foster and assist entrepreneurs internally.Want to get started now.\xa0 Take the pledge of entrepreneurship.\xa0 Click on the pledge below.\n\nTake the ABE Pledge of Entrepreneurship Now.\n\nPlease see our full list of frequently asked questions below or submit your own question.

u'\n\n\n\xa0Introduction\nWe\'re M\xedguelo Romano,\xa0a state-of-the-art urban men\u2019s designer clothing line born out of the streets of Brooklyn, New York and Medellin, Colombia.With this Kickstarter project, we aim to launch an innovative new clothing line this Fall as a tribute to one of Medellin\u2019s most important and influential hip hop artists, Elider Varela, otherwise known as "El Duke".Elider Varela "El Duke"The streets of Commune 13, where El Duke rose to fame, has long been one of Medellin\'s most dangerous neighborhoods. Contested by rival gangs, the neighborhood has the highest murder rate in the city while also being the most militarized. Young teens are indoctrinated into a lifestyle of violence early and forced to take sides among the various roving gangs. Crossing one of the "invisible barriers", which change frequently, means risking your life. \xa0\xa0Duke\'s lyrics and message ran against conventional wisdom - a message of peace, respect, and a mission to lift residents out of perpetual poverty to achieve something much greater.\n\nHip Hop School in Commune 13\n\nDuke was an inspirational community leader. His actions backed up the words in his music, founding the La Kamada hip hop school and volunteering his time on the streets to improve the neighborhood and and offer an alternative to children enticed by criminals and street gangs.Duke\'s message was clear - pick up a microphone and not a weapon.\n\n"El Duke"\n\nIn the early hours of October 2012, Duke was murdered by gang members in the very district that he was trying to save. He was killed for his message of hope, respect and peace - and for the crime of helping provide the youth in Medellin with and escape route from poverty and gang violence to better lives in pursuit of their dreams.\xa0The ClothingM\xedguelo Romano is an urban clothing brand made from the highest quality materials. If this project is funded, we will develop a line of shirts and hoodies with the image of El Duke and the phrase \u201cpaz y respeto\u201d, or \u2018peace and respect\u2019 in English. The prints will be designed by\xa0Fabian Higuita, one of Medellin\'s most respected graffiti artists.The clothing is street fashion and includes t-shirts, hoodies, jackets and jerseys. Designed for the urban gentleman who values his appearance, our clothing lines have a great fit and use only the highest quality fabrics. Hoodies have vintaged lambskin leather details along the zipper, pockets and elbows patches.\n\nReggaeton sensation Alberto Style rocking the Paz y Respeto\n\nBlade Resistant, Bullet ResistantEmbracing technology and advanced materials, the Duke collection includes clothing that use state-of-the-art fabrics that are resistant to both blades and bullets while remaining very light-weight and comfortable. Our intention is to create protective streetware that will provide peace-of-mind and security against would-be criminals.\xa0Within the last month, our clothing has recently been featured on\xa0NBC News,\xa0Colombia Reports\xa0and\xa0El Colombiano! \xa0\xa0\n\nThe Duke collection will be available in three versions - urban fashion (cotton), blade-resistant, and anti-ballistic.\n\nRadio MC with a cut-resistant M\xedguelo Romano hoodie\n\nThe safety and security aspect of the clothing is something that we take very seriously. The blade resistant fabric in our clothing line has been tested and graded according to strict industry specifications with the following ratings:\xa0\nEN ISO 13997\xa0Blade Cut Resistance (Level 4 - highest possible)\nASTM 1790-05\xa0Blade Cut Resistance (Level 4 - highest possible)\nEN 388: 2003 6.2\xa0Blade Cut Resistance (Level 5 - highest possible)\nOur anti-ballistic fabric has been proven in tests to be resistant to 9mm and .40 S&W caliber Full Metal Jacketed Round Nose (FMJ RN) bullets ("Type IIA amor")\xa0with a specified mass of 8.0 g (124 gr) and a velocity of 373 m/s \xb1 9.1 m/s (1225 ft/s \xb1 30 ft/s) and with .40 S&W Full Metal Jacketed (FMJ) bullets with a specified mass of 11.7 g (180 gr) and a velocity of 352 m/s \xb1 9.1 m/s (1155 ft/s \xb1 30 ft/s).Anti-ballistic clothing only covers vital areas on the torso and does not include coverage of the head or arms.For more information about our armored clothing, please visit the\xa0Miguelo Romano\xa0web site. Please also review our\xa0product terms and conditions.\xa0Your SupportIn order to get this line of clothing off the ground this summer, we need the support of our backers.

u"\nThe project and the about me really go hand in hand since I am the project. With the game of golf I have had more downs than ups with this game yet still cling to the possibility that I could play this game at the highest level. Right now with the cost of a good set of clubs being so high and working nights on an hourly wage it really doesn't cover the cost of being able to purchase them. This would be the first step on my road to becoming a Tour Professional. With the new set of clubs I would be able to start getting my golf game in order again. The reason I do not have clubs at the moment was that I was working at a golf course but with cost of living being so high all my money went to bills and food with one particularly bad month and unexpected bills I had to sell my golf clubs. My main goal is being able to acquire a sponsor to start playing the professional mini tours. These are also very expensive being you might need $40-50,0000 for year covering cost of living, play/practice time, traveling, coaching etc.... any money I receive over the cost of the equipment will go to pay for tournaments etc..\xa0 I am 33 years old, and have had a roller coaster of a time with golf in my life. I didn't get into the game till I was about 18. I got my handicap very low in my early 20s and did not play in college. I started playing the mini tours in Southern California when my then ex girlfriend decided to steal everything I own and leave me penniless. I decided to move out to AZ where my family was and start over, another time in my life where I had no golf clubs the game was forgotten for the next 7 years where I got into sales. What brought me back was when I went out and shot 71 first time on a golf course in almost a decade. I quit my sales job and got a job at a golf course. Playing and practicing I was able to get my game down to a +3 handicap and shooting mid 60s to low 70s consistently. The problem was that I had no money for tournaments and no contacts for a sponsor. Now here I am today, I gave up on golf over a year ago frustrated but it has never left my mind. I watch the television coverage every week dreaming I was there. This is pretty much one of my last shots at doing something. Thank you very much!\n"

u'\nThe HistoryIn the heyday of the drive-in theater, just shy of a dozen of these movie mammoths graced Tucson. Families piled into cars to go see the latest flick. Relationships flourished in the glow of of the giant screen. Slowly over the decades as land prices became a premium, indoor venues began to take over the movie scene until just one drive-in remained in Pima County. Originally the Cactus Drive-In Theatre, it was renamed the DeAnza in 1977 and kept the name until its destruction in 2009. Many mourned the downfall of Tucson\'s last drive-in theater. As a result the Cactus Drive-In Theater Foundation was formed, and its Facebook page blossomed to nearly 1500 followers since April 2014.The CauseThe Cactus Drive-In Theater Foundation is a nonprofit in Tucson, AZ, with the intention of bringing the drive-in theater tradition back to our town. Our ultimate goal is to establish a permanent, community-owned drive-in theater in Pima County. This Kickstarter project will bring us one step closer to fulfilling that dream.\xa0The Kickstarter ProjectThe funds raised through this project will go towards the purchase of a large inflatable movie screen, high-quality movie projector, and generator. These materials, paired with our FM transmitter and authentic restored drive-in movie speakers, will allow us to host "pop up" drive-in movie events throughout Pima County (anywhere lighting and space conditions allow). This "pop-up"\xa0model is currently being implemented successfully in Punta Gorda, Florida to show monthly drive-in movies for their community, so we are confident it will also be a success for Pima County! As we are a nonprofit, much of your contribution is tax deductible and goes a long way to realizing the dream of a drive-in for our county.The FutureWhen we acquire a permanent location for a drive-in, we can continue to use the inflatable screen for several years. A special movie projector is required to show new, first-run movies (which is not in the scope of this Kickstarter project). Other infrastructure (a permanent snack bar, flush toilets, etc.) can be added over time.The Rewards\n\n\nFor Drivers: Show your support with a bumper sticker! This reward will send a message to fellow drivers that your car deserves the treat of a relaxing drive-in movie.\n\n\nFor Movie Goers: For $15, $20, $39, or $100, you can get admission to one or more of our "pop up" drive-in events! Our aim is to host a wide range of movies in various locations throughout Pima County, so if you live anywhere in the Tucson area, this is bound to be a good deal for you and a car load of friends!\n\n\nFor Clothing Wearers:\xa0The $25 and $39 tiers include a t-shirt with the original Cactus Drive-In Theatre logo in green on the front of the shirt.\n\n\n\xa0For Business Owners: Imagine your advertisement (or any family-friendly shout-out) emblazoned on a giant outdoor screen in front of a captive audience prior to a feature film. We\'ll include your advertisement prior to at LEAST ten events. This comes out to less than $5 per event for a still image on a repeating loop, or $20 per event for a video advertisement immediately before the film!\n\n\n\xa0For Vintage Drive-In Theater Buffs: These vintage speakers and display poles are hand-restored by board member George Cohn, who has decades of experience nursing these abandoned speakers back to life.\xa0These speakers are not replicas but actual speakers from the heyday of the drive-in era. The speakers may have once played the sounds of classics from Gone With the Wind to Star Wars. These rare pieces of Americana can be used with your home theater system or put on display at car shows or antique fairs. Each speaker will come in its original metal hue or the color(s) of your preference (red, off-white, blue, and dark grey).\n\n\n\xa0For Your Own Drive-In Experience: Have you always wanted to see your favorite movie on the big screen again? Now\'s your chance! At the $2000 tier you can choose the movie for one of our events! (Not all movies in existence are available for licensing due to studio re-releases, etc. While most movies greater than a year out of the theater are available, if you have a specific movie in mind please contact us as to availability.) If you want to make it a private party, $5000 will allow you to not only pick the movie, but the guests as well! Invite as many or as few people as you want, so long as the space can accommodate them. Popcorn is included, and we\'ll try our best to make it a night to remember for whatever occasion you\'re celebrating.FAQWhat are the legalities of showing older films in a public setting?You can\'t just show any movie in public without paying a commission to the studios.  DVD\'s are typically sold for "private performance only,"\nFor a private party on private property and no charge for admission, you can pretty much show any DVD in your collection.\n However,\n for public events - whether you charge admission or not - movies must be licensed through one of the companies that license films for public performance such as Criterion or Swank.\nSome movies available for public presentation require that you pay the studios a percentage of the admission fee.  This is typically true with films from the Disney studios as well as a few others.\nAll movies that we show to the public are properly licensed.What kind of movies do you plan to show?\n\xa0Primarily family friendly - but not necessarily limited to G or PG.\n\xa0What kind of movies can I show at a private party?\nAnything you want, as long as you own the DVD!\n'

u"\n\n\nHello Everyone!Bella is a 3yr old Border Collie who is insane for disc dog competitions! She has competed many times placing in every event she's entered. She is currently ranked as an Advanced Disc Dog with the Canadian Disc Dog Association.  I, David Shirreffs, am her handler for most events and have found disc dogging with her extremely therapeutic and beneficial in coping with the symptoms of my Bipolar Disorder. \xa0I never imagined myself being able to compete with Bee, it started as just something to keep me focused and to keep her entertained privately. \xa0As you can see in the video I've been able to overcome my fears of crowds and enjoy myself. Everything in my life has had to be routine, my wife Kari, can attest to what even the smallest of change does to my stability and health, but being able to train 5 days a week and compete often has given me the chance to meet people and their words of encouragement and cheers have built my confidence. I've lived with Bipolar for 30 of my 40 years, I'm lucky to have such a loving and understanding family, my wife and 4 daughters, lord only knows how they've been able to cope with me. \xa0Until recently I had kept my illness a secret from almost everyone, except family and close friends, from shame, embarrassment, judgment and ridicule but as I've grown older I've slowly become accepting and proud for my accomplishments in life despite this disorder. \xa0On the days where BP has got a grip on me Kari steps up and hucks for Bella whether it's practice or Competition, without her support we'd never have been able to come this far.It's never been about winning it's about being able to show up on competition day and let everyone see Bella's talent and ability, and secretly beating Bipolar for a day.\xa0\n\nHigh Flying!!\n\nWith the costs associated with competitions which include entrance fees, travelling and the discs themselves, Bella destroys about 6-12 discs per competition, we've found a need to try and raise the funds here to buy her competition discs in bulk from the supplier at a much lower cost and have them personalized. I'll be designing the artwork myself for the discs. \xa0Our practice discs are made out of different material and last much longer but are not competition standard.\xa0We have our discs shipped in from the United States, they're not sold in our area, I don't think they're sold in Canada at all, with each one equalling out to be around $10. \xa0Buying them in a bulk \xa0sum we'd be able to reduce the cost to approximately $3.\xa0We wish to continue competing at these high levels and thank everyone for taking a peek and hopefully pledging!Cheers,Dave, Kari and Bee\n\nThe teeth that do all the damage!\n\n\nThe Damage after 6 catches!!\n\nWith Punctures and knawing the disc becomes useless and dangerous.\xa0\n\n\n"

u"\n*International orders please add 10.00 Dollars for European and 2.00 dollars for Canadian shipping.*\xa0Providing you an all-in-one leash, the Bungee Buddy Leash is a product both you and your dog will enjoy. Anywhere, anytime and in every way.Retractable - Tangle Free\n\nBungee Buddy Leash vs Standard leash\n\nA retractable leash is the best leash design to own. Without being stretched out, Bungee Buddy Leash is merely 2ft of lead length - keeping your pup near your side. When your dog walks, they have the ability to stretch out the leash up to 5ft. You do not need to constantly keep control of how close or far your pup can/cannot venture. The best part? There is No slack for you or pup to get tangled in!Length Adjustable\n\n\nBungee leashes are wonderful, but do you know of any that can adjust in length? Leashes that Do control length are not easily retractable. You\u2019re gathering up extra lead length, you\u2019re pushing a button to reel in the leash but your pup pulls it out further, etc.With Bungee Buddy, our leash can easily be adjusted to your desired length. Grabbing and pulling the cord out of the leash, you can shorten and lock the length, from the full 5ft down to 2ft.Tension Adjustable\n\n\nThrough scientific research, it is proven that 65% of dog injuries (in their neck, spine, and particularly the thyroid gland), are the result of leash jerking. Additional research links aggressive/behavioral problems between the resulting injuries produced by leash jerking.Part of the Bungee Buddy Leash\u2019s all-in-one qualities, is a way to adjust the amount of tension on your pups lead. At the shortest length setting, your pup will receive the strongest amount of tension from the leash. As you adjust the length, for a longer leash, the amount of tension decreases. This allows your pup to experience gradual tension on their own, as they pull on the lead. This will help teach your pup that the more they pull, the more tension their leash will give. Therefore teaching them over time to stand near you, and even respond immediately to you.No jerking, no harsh restraining, and no resulting harm to neck or spine.Dual Lead\n\n\nWhether having more than one dog or walking neighboring pups, it becomes an immediate challenge on a standard leash.One of the many aspects of the Bungee Buddy Leash is its ability to become a dual leash any moment you wish. The cord lock attachment has a snap hook (see picture below), that allows you to attach one or more Bungee Buddy Leashes - forming dual leads. At any moment you want separate leashes, simply detach them in a few seconds. Using multiple Bungee Buddy Leashes, you have the assurance of the leads\u2019 not getting tangled in one another, as well as being able to adjust their individual lead lengths.\n\n\nQuality\n\n\nThe quality of the Bungee Buddy Leash is very important not only to us, but for you as a dog owner as well. Every component used in the Bungee Buddy Leash has been lab tested to earn the documented rating it received.Tensile Strength;\xa0-Nylon Strap: 4,000lbs-Bungee Cord: 160lbs-Snap Hooks: 170lbs-Metal D Ring: 280lbs\n\xa0With a labor intensive production line and mounting interest in the Bungee Buddy Leash, we need to increase the efficiency in which we produce each unit. Reaching our goal of 5,500 dollars, we can upgrade existing equipment and buy the additional needed equipment to ensure not only a drastically more efficient production line, we can also reduce the cost per unit as well.\xa0By offering you the chance to be some of the first people in the world to own a Bungee Buddy Leash, we can raise the capital needed to accomplish this. Instead of turning to private investors - who usually don't share the same level of commitment to safety, quality and community as we do. We've decided to turn to this kick ass community to raise the needed capital, maintain control of the safety and quality of each Bungee Buddy Leash and also maintain a valuable standing in our community through job creation and public works. The Bungee Buddy leash is as much a part of our family as your furry four legged kiddo is a part of your family.\xa0Please take your time and enjoy the color/ pattern swatches plus the other pictures and video. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to reach out to us at BungeeBuddyLeash@gmail.com and we'll be happy to assist you.\xa0International orders please add 10.00 Dollars for European shipping and 2.00 Dollars for Canadian shipping.\n\nAvailable colors under reward section\n\n\nAvailable patterns under reward section\n\nAbout us:\xa0Christopher and Emily together form an amazing team. They complement each other on every level. As mother and father, best friends and loving couple, together they crush any obstacle in their path.

Project updates will be posted as more retail hardware\nlocations are recruited. The reasons retail merchants have and will agree to\ndisplay Better Bins is the curiosity feature outside the store, number of\npotential sales in their area, healthy markup, and a well-priced manufactures\nsuggested retail. The retail pilot stores will be in combination with Google Ad Words\nadvertisements focused in the same demographic area until exposure is gained\nbefore the Toronto Home Show in March of 2015. The home show will signal the\nshift to focusing more residential sales through local retailers and on line.\nFrom the beginning there will be a small profit margin for Better Bins sold\nthrough retailers with online sales offering increased margins. As volume\nincreases and scaling begins more profits will allow for greater advertising\nbefore crossing the border and establishing a rep network in the US. The US\nEnvironmental Protection Agency provides excellent links to the municipalities\nthat currently use two wheeled waste containers for citizen waste collection. The initial production run of the medium bin size or\napartment/condo Better Bins enclosure will be broken down to fabricating each\nrequired part individually before the parts are sub assembled, assembled,\nfinished, dried and flat packed. When packaged the panels will be strapped\ntogether with corner protectors, hardware, assembly, and instructions within the\nbar code labeled packet as shown. Both the swivelling feet (as shown below) and safety hook located\non the underside of the enclosure lid provide the height adjustment for variation\nbetween manufactures wheeled bin sizes. \n\n\nThe frames for each panel are constructed of pressure\ntreated FSC 2\u201dx2\u201d Miter cut and fitted together after each of the pieces has\nbeen run through a shaper that cuts an inward facing recess for the spaced\ninfill slats to fit into.The slats are first cut into long strips ripped from sheets\nof plywood before being cut to length, and laid into a jig that spaces each\nslat as they contact a glue prepped surface before being pneumatically secured\nwith three fasteners on each end of every slat. Once each of the panels is assembled and the glue has cured\neach is dipped into the factory finish semitransparent slate green weather\nproofing. The dipping process is much more thorough and does not require a\nspray booth and apparatus. The factory slate green finish and spars slat\ngeneral design is our best attempt at providing the cloaking cover effect. This\nconstruction is also a balance of total mass for shipping , shading from the sun,\nventilation, protection from animals, cost of material, functional stability,\nFSC certified material and basic prerequisite of adding as much value as\npossible considering every thing we know is now on the market.

u'\nCopper is a documentary short about people living on the margins of society. The film\xa0takes a third-eye perspective, to tell the untold story behind the day-to-day hustle of scrappers battling drug addiction. \xa0Copper follows three individuals, all of whom are intravenous drug users (IDUs) living outside of homes, to document their success, failures, and the basic commonalities of everyday life.There have been films about scrapping.\xa0There have been films about people who shoot drugs.\xa0There has never been a film that portrays these individuals without defining them by their addiction.\xa0\nOur priority is to document the depth and complexity of these individuals\u2019 lives. It\u2019s been staggering to see the amount of work and daily resilience necessary to survive. The subjects of Copper persevere on the fringe -- finding value in what others have left behind.Copper isn\'t an exploration of right or wrong. \xa0It is a film that seeks to tell address the stigma placed on people who have been defined by where they live and the drugs they use.\xa0About the productionWhen you tell a person you are going to make a film documenting scrappers who are also drug users people tend to say one of two things. They ask you if it\'s safe, and they ask you how you are ever going to find people who will let you film them. We asked ourselves the same questions.Since last January we have been working with community leaders, outreach workers, advocacy groups, and anyone and everyone who could tell us about scrapping. Finally we decided we had to get out and start talking to people.It took months of hitting the streets to find the subjects for Copper. Our director and film crew have been waking up at 5:30 am -- walking under bridges, hopping fences -- in order to find injection sites to connect with people. \xa0Once we created relationships the team began to follow "Sam" and "Nick" in their daily routine. Through weeks of spending time with "Sam" and "Nick" we have captured an honest, intimate, and rare portrayal of the true complexity of this life.\xa0Why are we here?The Copper team is made up of six people, and we are all volunteers. We have invested our time and resources to get where we are today. The funds we raise with this campaign will allow us to continue to compensate the subjects of the film for their time (we provide gift-cards for food and other necessities), post-production costs, and will fund our ability to share this story with the world.Your support of this project will not only make all of these things happen, you will also help to begin to bridge the gap between perception and reality.\n'

Our goal for 2014-2015 is to have all the\nresources in place to become fully functional with our first phase which\nincludes our men\u2019s and women\u2019s clothing line, and an interactive website that\nwill work on your phone, tablet, and PC. We have already launched our product\nline on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram (crownclothingcc) which has generated a\nbuzz with people who are eager to buy our products. We currently have numerous\npeople who have liked our Facebook page as well as many views and likes on our\nInstagram page. A portion of the funds we receive from your donations will help\nboost our online presence so that we will be able to reach more teens and young\nadults which is a big part of our target demographic.Our plan for our upcoming clothing line is\nto get involved with and help set current trends within the urban fashion\nindustry. We will accomplish this by creating a unique and stylish online\nmarketing campaign which will include short online commercials, web banner\nadvertising, and company to individual direct marketing. Our direct marketing\ncampaign is close to being fully functional as we have a mailing list of\n10,000+ individuals we will be reaching out to in hopes of getting people\nfamiliar with our brand and wares.Our short term goal is to have a business\nthat will thrive in the urban clothing industry by having clothing tailored not\nto just a specific group but to a wide range of people around the world, but\nCrown Clothing\u2019s ultimate goal is to cater to every one across every class for\nclothing and accessories. Our logo is very distinctive (a gold C with a crown)\nand can be used on any type of clothing or accessories. The gold C with a crown\nis meant to show and inspire various forms of success, achievement, and status\nthat everyone can relate too.Our current process of manufacturing our\nproducts is expensive and leaves little room for a profit margin which can be\nput back into the company to upgrade our operations; that is why we are turning\nto Kickstarter. Along with promoting, we would use part of the funds to buy a\nsmall inventory of clothing at a much better price. We have spoken with\nclothing makers and have priced the cost of each unit to be as low as three\ndollars per unit. That would help to start generating enough capital to start\nputting more back into the business in order to expand our operations which\nwould include eventually taking control of our own manufacturing.Finally, we here at Crown Clothing LLC\nbelieve very strongly in giving and charitable work. We hope to become a\nsuccessful enough venture to not only be able to donate funds in large\nquantities to charities such as United Way, Salvation Army, and Feeding\nAmerica, but to also start manufacturing plants in underdeveloped or once\nthriving but abandon cities such as Detroit, Cleveland, and Stockton, CA. We\nbelieve that the best help someone can receive is through well paid meaningful\nemployment and we hope to be able to bring that help to as many as we can. From\nall of us here at Crown Clothing LLC, we thank you for your time and\nconsideration.\n'

u'\nMy take on Clouds (#CLOUD$) aims to highlight the increasing skepticism evident \nin the media about the monetary value of a liberal arts degree, particularly degrees in \u201csoft\u201d subjects \nlike the arts and humanities, and particularly as these degrees become increasingly expensive. We also propose to humorously grapple with outside perceptions of the students who attend elite colleges, or what we, from the inside, perceive these distorted assumptions to be.\nMy preparations for directing this show have been taking place for over a year now in the form \nof fellowships and coursework. I started my adaptation while working in Cyprus with the International\nAncient Greek Drama Festival there on a grant from the Garrett Albert Summer Fund. The previous \nspring, I had taken Helene Foley\u2019s Aristophanes course at Barnard, in which we translated Clouds. When I returned\nfrom Cyprus, I continued to work on the concept and look of #CLOUD$ for a final paper for Elizabeth\nScharffenberger\u2019s comedy class at Columbia last fall. Both professors have been vocal and instrumental in generating support for #CLOUD$. \xa0Aristophanes\u2019 Clouds was actually his least successful production, and the version we have \nhanded down to us by scribes may be one that was still being edited for re-performance at the time of \nAristophanes\u2019 death, which makes the show play a bit disjointedly. The play takes place predominantly at the \u201cThinkery,\u201d a haven for Socrates and \nother pasty intellectuals who swindle people out of money to teach them dubiously helpful things, like \nhow many feet a flea leaps. Unable to pick up on Socrates\u2019 wisdom himself, Strepsiades sends his \nson, a prospective chariot racer, to the school, in hopes that he will come back able to \u201cmake the \nweaker argument appear the stronger.\u201d When Pheidippides, Strepsiades\u2019 son, returns from the \nThinkery, his newly learned argument is that because his father is senile, he cannot make him do \nanything, and that it is the job of a good son to \u201ccare\u201d for an aging parent the same way his parents \ncared for him: by beating him when he did something wrong.\xa0My production takes much from the \noriginal but most notably diverges with respect to the role of gender in the identity of the Clouds (and, \nin my version, the capacity of Strepsiades\u2019 daughter, Mustang Sally, to become one of them).\nOur #CLOUD$ is very much controlled by the Chorus as the instigator of the action within the play, \nand expressing the identity of the Cloud Chorus is one of the main concerns of the show. Instead of airy \ngoddesses, the Clouds are comically distorted caricatures of young women from wealthy families who attend elite colleges like Barnard \nand Columbia. These women, because they come from money, think nothing of declaring \u201cuseless\u201d \nmajors, or taking "easy" courses, because their performance at college has no bearing on the success \nwaiting to be handed down to them upon graduation. They are literally untouchable, like the airy \ngoddesses of Aristophanes\u2019 original.\xa0The play itself follows Strepsiades, a New Jersey father indebted to his daughter\u2019s passion \nfor horses, on his quest to become a fancy talker, a manipulator, like the people who come out of \nthese hoity-toity liberal arts colleges. After failing to learn the finer talking points of intellectualism and \nliberalism, he sends his daughter, a more moldable youth, to study at Barnard. She returns a \u201ccrunchy \ngranola hipster,\u201d much to Strepsiades\u2019 dissatisfaction, and now has stronger views on dismantling the \npatriarchy than she does on finding legal loopholes to save her father. In a fit of rage, Strepsiades burns \ndown the projected fa\xe7ade of Butler Library.I think that mounting a \nproduction that is heavily adapted and in English will prompt debate about the strengths and \nweaknesses of my approach vis-\xe0-vis the approach of the\xa0Matthew Alan Kramer\xa0Fund, which supports \nonly productions in Ancient Greek and Latin. I hope our show will take a definitive stance within the \nGreek Drama adaptation and reception community about what it means to make a faithful production \nof a piece from antiquity and whether that means attempting to recreate aesthetics or experience, \nbecause it is truly impossible to successfully recreate both.\xa0\nI am asking for $2600 to support the production, half of which will go to reserving the theater \nalone. We will be using this funding additionally for costumes, props and publicity, with any leftover \ngoing towards shipping and high-quality printed donor rewards and framed posters for those faculty at Columbia \nwho have supported the production in any capacity, especially Liz Scharffenberger and Helene Foley.\xa0Our performances will be in the Glicker-Millstein Theater at Barnard College from October 28th to 30th, so even if you choose not to donate, come check us out! We\'ll be the ones in cotton ball tutus.For more information follow us on twitter @AncientDrama or on tumblr at\xa0http://bccuancientdrama.tumblr.com/\n'

u'\n#CLOUD$ is a modern take on Aristophanes\u2019 Clouds which confronts the \u201cvalue\u201d of a liberal arts education, emotionally, intellectually\u2026but mostly monetarily.  When Strepsiades\u2019 daughter, Mustang Sally, refuses to enroll at Barnard, Strepsiades decides to go in her place, and meets the magnanimous Socrates and his smitten Clouds.  When Strepsiades\u2019 dream to be edified by Socrates in the niceties of intellectual discourse (or, for regular people, to learn to talk all fancy-like) doesn\u2019t work out the way he planned, Strepsiades forces Sally to go, because she, unlike him, is still a moldable youth. When Sally returns from her time at Barnard, seeking a Masters in Art History rather than a JD, her father, overwhelmed by the pressure to pay back his and her student debt, decides to take matters into his own hands.\xa0\xa0Remaining faithful to the spirit of the original Clouds, and daring to take a stance on the generalizations about and growing pains of the oft-labeled \u201cMillennial Generation,\u201d #CLOUD$ is everything you didn\u2019t know you wanted to do on a late October weeknight.

u"\nChef Supreme is a chef competition where executive chefs from around the country battle it out for supremacy. \xa0The show is meant to be a slightly more serious offering, which means no challenges that involve wacky ingredients or insane roadblocks...it's all about taste and skill. This is a web series that would be also used as a tv pilot.\n\n\nWell, it's a cooking competition.  If you've seen Top Chef or Master Chef or Chopped...then you're familiar with what we're doing.  Where we stray from those shows is that the contestants are only executive chefs and we don't send anyone home.  Those might seem like little differences, but they're actually quite huge.  Survivor wasn't the first reality competition show and it wasn't the first show that eliminated contestants but it's certainly responsible for every show since following their formula....including cooking shows.  I love all of these shows and I still watch all of them...but...and I'm probably in the minority...but I don't feel you can truly find the best when you have several rounds and eliminate one person every time.   Chefs need to battle each other over and over and show a pattern of consistency.   But on a typical show good chefs are eliminated over minor mistakes and mediocre chefs advance simply because someone else did a little worse than they did in a particular round. \xa0And some of the more...surreal....cooking show challenges can be unfair even to the best chef.  Still, it's all debatable which process is best.  But for my show everyone stays and fights to the very end and at the very least it's something that separates from the two dozen other cooking competitions.\n\n\nTHE FORMAT\r\n\r\n\xa010 executive chefs are brought from around the country to compete in Minneapolis.  They battle 3 times and episode for 7 episodes.  The best 3 chefs compete in the final episode.  Elimination rounds are great for suspense and really push the chefs to their limits.  In order to keep that suspense level without an elimination it will come down to money.  Each contestant is given an appearance fee at the beginning of the series.  In every competition (and there are 3 per episode) the chefs that find themselves at the bottom have to give a portion of their money to those who are at the top.   The finale is between the 3 chefs with the most money.  This way those who skate by in the middle of pack won't find themselves in the finale after flying under the radar.   The best 3 chefs battle it out in the finale's 3 rounds. THE PILOT\r\n\r\n\xa0We're seeking funds to do a pilot that we can take to places like The Food Network, TLC, Bravo, etc.  The pilot is an abbreviated version of the season....so a winner would be crowned in the pilot (plus we'd have fewer chefs). We'd need less if this was just a web series, but this is also a pilot and has to look as professional as possible to be taken seriously. The amount listed is just enough to do this.\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\xa0EXTRA\r\n\r\n\xa0If by some great luck we exceed our goal, depending on the excess amount, we can add more chefs and do extra episodes...even all 8.  Also, some of the perks listed are specific to the show being viewed.  Before we send the pilot to the networks it will run online as a four part web series, so people will see your contribution.\n"

u"\nThe quest for an ultra-light cooking solution\u2026Several years ago I was in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness cooking over a Coleman two burner propane stove waiting for water to boil. It was cool, rainy and there was a slight breeze. No matter how I moved the camp stove the wind seemed to affect my ability to cook, so I started to think about how I could make this situation better.\xa0Several generations later and a lot of field testing I came up with what I call the Critter CR2 and I believe that it resolves the problems that I had with commercially available camp stoves. Features like a low center of gravity and teeth on the main supporting structure virtually eliminate tipping your food over while cooking. A sleek design allows the CR2 to be packed nearly anywhere you can imagine.\xa0Whether you are a hard core hiker, canoeist, campground camper, biker or a weekend camper, the CR2 camp stove stand combined with your favorite stove makes for a simple and easy cooking experience anywhere you are.\xa0\n\n\n\xa0Production Plan Status: I am working with a manufacturer in Minnesota that is ISO 9001:2008 certified to manufacture samples and the first production runs. Testing of the initial concept design has been completed and the next step of production samples have been reviewed and tested as well. A mini press has been procured along with a set of custom dies for each wing to bend the tabs with precision.\xa0Before I can ship the Critter CR2 I need to raise money to complete these last steps. This is where you come in -\nProcure raw materials for the stand and packaging\nPlace a production order\nStretch Goal: If enough money is raised I want to develop a set of progressive dies to run the CR2 wings in a coil fed press.\nTimeline:\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0Rewards\n\n\n\xa0\n"

u'\nFROM INVISIBLE CITIES TO CELESTIAL CITIESFor the past 5 years I\'ve been working as an illustrator, and every time I\'ve had a little spare time I\'ve found myself coming back to the novel Invisible Cities by Italo Calvino. It\'s become something of an obsession- I\'ve read and re-read it dozens of times, incorporated it into my architecture degree, based a solo exhibition on it, and produced limited edition screen prints inspired by its passages.\xa0My love of architecture and art have met as I\'ve been illustrating different cities, real and imaginary. With this project I\'ve taken things to a whole new level, looking beyond earth and imagining cities scattered out in space. The 9 prints I\'ve produced form a set representing the main celestial bodies in our solar system, from the Sun all the way out to Neptune.CELESTIAL CITIES PRINTS\nThe 9 prints in this series will each be a limited edition of 100, printed by hand using woodblocks, then signed and numbered. The paper I\'m wanting to use for these prints is Fabriano Rosaspina, a beautiful heavy cotton art paper.\n\n\nEach print measures 35cm x 50cm (about 13.5" x 19.5") including a white border. The textures will vary slightly between each print, and the final colours might be subtly different to the previews here (depending on what inks I use).\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you love the art but can\'t stretch to get your hands on the limited edition block prints, you can still help me out by getting A4 digital prints or a set of postcards, all printed onto heavy satin card.\n\nA4 digital print of \'Uranus\'\n\n\nPostcard set featuring all 9 of the Celestial Cities\n\nA NEW PRINTING PROCESS\nIn the past I\'ve worked closely with screen printers and printing presses to produce really high quality limited editions of my artwork, but recently I\'ve been wanting to get my hands a bit dirty myself.Earlier this year I experimented with a method that was entirely new to me - wood block printing - and I produced a small limited edition called Kites Over the Crags for a Gallery in Edinburgh. The results were tactile and beautiful, and I wanted to develop the method further.\n\nKites Over the Crags - the first print series I produced using bock printing\n\nThe printing process involves laser engraving my artwork onto wooden board, which then acts as a master block for all the prints. Inks are spread over the block, and each print is pressed by hand to produce the print. Using a laser engraved board means fantastic details can be achieved, while tiny inconstancies in the surface of the wood produce textures that make every print unique.\n\nLaser engraved wooden board for the \'Sun\' print\n\n\nEach print will be made individually by hand, using the engraved boards and block printing ink.\n\n\nTest prints show the subtle textures that the printing process produces.\n\nWHY I NEED YOUR HELPEven though I\'m printing everything myself by hand, there are quite a few big expenses that I need to overcome before I can get stuck in, like buying all the art paper, stocking up on inks and equipment, and making the remaining laser engraved wooden boards.

u"\nMy Father and I were sitting and talking one day, and my kids, I am a single Dad with two children, they were baby's at the time. They were in they're baby strollers and the little girl next door was in a\xa0Barbie Jeep. My Dad and I both looked at\xa0my baby's and saw the look\xa0on they're little faces, they were so excited seeing the little girl in the Jeep. I said to my Dad there should be something for baby's like that.\xa0This is when I came up with this idea and my dream. My Father passed away\xa0soon after. I designed a baby stroller for the\xa0new infants\xa0and toddlers, to make a difference in the\xa0baby stroller industry,\xa0to be an exciting new\xa0beginning in life for them. Not just the same baby strollers that have been out there for decades. I'm trying to raise the money to manufacture the baby strollers to get them on the market.\n"

u"\nOne day while sitting on the porch with my Dad and my kids, we saw the next door neighbor in her Barbie Jeep driving up and down the driveway. \xa0My kids got very excited and started smiling, kicking and make a good fuss looking at the neighbor in her Barbie Jeep. They wanted out of their basic stroller and into that Barbie Jeep. \xa0 If baby's can get envious my kids had a real bad case of it. \xa0That was my Ahaa! Moment. \xa0My dad and I talked about how we need to come up with a stroller that can provide that type of fun for infants and toddlers. \xa0 Cool Ride was born in my head in that instant so every kid could have that happy feeling of cruising in a Cool Ride. \xa0It has been years in the making and we have our first prototype. \xa0What a milestone that was. When we take it for test drives everyone stops us. With your help and support via this Kickstarter Campaign we will be able to bring Cool Ride to reality and that would make your kids and you very happy.\xa0\n"

u'\nThis is a partnership of\xa02 educators with a diverse background. One a life long farmer turned science teacher, and one a businessman turned special educator. We have summers open and usually look for jobs or return to past summer jobs. We plan to take control of our time and create a greater hands-on\nlearning experience for the whole family all while providing a healthy and\nfun environment with the intention of staying as natural and sustainable\xa0as possible. We want a "grow and pick your own produce farm" that will focus on\ngourds, fruit, vegetables, with the added fall attraction of a corn\nmaze to assure more a more economically viable operation.We will to start with leased farm land (with option to purchase\nlater) to keep overhead low as possible,\xa0close to\xa0a popular coastal community as we can\nget it (we already have this in negotiation). Belfast has a very healthy natural and farming community and will quickly embrace this business.Our first season will be more limited\xa0offering\xa0pumpkins, and vegetables for salad and salsa\nalong with the corn maze. Fruits will follow, strawberries and raspberries will produce the\nsecond year. We have the options to add apples and Christmas trees with a 5-7\nyr production schedule. With one more added crop is the very popular corn mazes that\nhave appeared here in Maine. We want to do an evening/night corn maze and/or\nhaunted corn maze to distinguish ourselves from the others. The closest on is 1 1/2 hr drive away so we will corner the local market.The desire is to create an experience that\xa0families can enjoy a day\xa0of picking their own produce\xa0with hands on learning and healthy food options. \n'

u'\nCoastal Family FarmsJason Bishop & Jonathan Sawyer505-5052 bishopjason2012@gmail.comwww.Coastalfamilyfarms.comhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/980507149/coastal-family-farmsBackground: Both\nco-owners started as coworkers in special education at a local school district\nhowever we ended up there in very different ways. One is a lifelong farmer who\nturned to education for better benefits and I worked in Commercial Insurance\n& Surety Bonding before I wanting more time with my children so I too\nturned to education. Jonathan\u2019s degree is in Science education and I have a\nBusiness Administration degree, working on my MBA. We both loved our jobs but\nit does not provide for summer employment and we are both paid hourly. After a\nfew days of preparing for summer and discussing options we felt it was best to\nuse our summers for something better than \u201cfinding work\u201d we both had similar\npassions and very complimentary skill sets that can benefit us and our\ncommunity. Our Goal: The\nfamily in Coastal Family Farms is the customers; our plan is a place where\npeople feel free to bring their family and pick the produce themselves, learn\nand have fun. We want kids to see where their food comes from and then see it\non the dinner table later that night. We will make ourselves available to walk\naround show kids/families what we have, what we use in our \u201clife size farm\ntouch tank\u201d and answer questions. We know how much work there is but we want the\nend result to be fun!!! We both are fun loving family oriented guys and think that\ncan be brought to this industry just as Ben and Jerry made Ice Cream fun. If\nfeasible we would prefer to be organic but definitely want as natural as\npossible as we both believe this is the healthiest option. We are carefully planning to make the use of\nour time, product and money as careful as we want to keep this as efficient and\nsustainable as possible.Our Plan: Our intention with\nthis startup money is to secure the land through a long term lease and buy agricultural\nsupplies. We have enough connections to initially not have to buy a lot of\nequipment to keep our startup cost feasible. During the fall we want to do soil\ntesting through UMaine cooperative extension, use this information during the\nwinter of \u201914-\u201915 and design the layout with parking. In early spring we will\nprep the land and start planting. Through farming contacts we have already\nreached an agreement to buy high quality produce way below market price for\nresale to supplement our own make sure we have enough supply in our first few\nseasons until we can work out the finer details with supply and demand. The\nfirst year we will start by planting everything to yield vegetables and prepare\nthe fruit plants to yield in the following season(s). The vast majority of our\nmoney will be made through the Haunted Corn Maze which will provide cross\nselling pumpkin/gourd opportunities and publicity for future years. The Haunted\ncorn maze will be a toned down version for families during the day, shut down\nin the afternoon to set up for a more intensive experience in the evenings done\nby moon and solar light. We plan to resource High School drama clubs and other\ntrained volunteers who want to join in on the good time of scaring people just\nas I have volunteered for\xa0another popular haunted tour\xa0multiple times myself. After the\nseason we will sell back the corn field, any lower quality or unusable product\nto local farmers for feed in an attempt to reduce waste.I have many media connections ( I worked as a\nphotojournalist while in college) through various media outlets to provide a\nlow cost yet very public marketing campaign combined with a very active social\nmedia campaign, which has already begun with our Facebook Coastal Family Farms\npage already started.Our Market: The\nnegotiation has already begun on a long term lease with option very near an\nactive area in town. This fits our desire to be as close to Belfast as\npossible. It has a more affluent community that is full of life and creativity,\nit has a thriving natural food coop, limited competition, and we feel it will\nquickly embrace an \u2018out of the box\u2019 venture of this kind.The 3 closest corn mazes are Blue Hill,\nLevant and Corinna all well over an hour away. With the draw of the corn maze\nand distinguishing itself from the others as the states (currently) only\nhaunted corn maze we believe we can not only create healthy food options but we\ncan create an attraction. Waldo County area has many wonderful features but limited\nfamily outing options. The Nuts, Bolts & Seeds:Pick your\nown Fruit: Apples, Strawberries, raspberries (these will not yield crop the\nfirst season)Farm stand\nand/or pick your own vegetables: All standard Salad and Salsa vegetables, corn,\npumpkins & gourdsEcotourism Features:Haunted Corn\nMazeFamily\ninvolvement; fun days at a farm at a leisurely pace.Other Community Benefits:Summer\nemployment for us and othersHealthy food\noption/local grown produceHands on\nlearning environmentLots of\npotential for future products and/or additional locationsEconomic draw to the area\n'

(full show schedule on www.theseersband.com.) \xa0Our biggest challenge, then, has been finding the time and help to promote and distribute our original music. \xa0That\'s where some professional (and costly) help comes in.\xa0Over the past year, we\'ve already invested hours and hours and $3500 in production and initial promotion costs for this album. We are hoping to raise another $3000 to finish releasing, distributing, and promoting the new record more professionally. \xa0\xa0The total cost for the printed CDs, shirts, hoodies, swag and party will approach $2700. To market our album to local and municipal buyers and professionalize our website, we\'re looking at another $2000. \xa0So, our goal of $3000 is not to return any profit, but to begin to cover the costs of getting this album out there. \xa0Help us celebrate the new record by backing our professional efforts. \xa0 \xa0\xa0As an additional thanks to backers, We\'re getting a specially made, complimentary keg of Equinox "Seers beer" for our beloved backer attendees!! (the show is all ages. \xa021+ with proof of I.D. required for beer.) \xa0\xa0If we do extremely well, we will post specifics about our cool stretch goals. I will post updates and song samples soon - \xa0 \xa0\n~ a special note from the blind jogger ~\n9/5/2014\nHello Fort Collins community,\n\n\nMany of you have come to know me affectionately as the blind jogger, a half cracked gentleman with cane in hand, willing to jog in weather ranging from 0 to 100 degrees, Fahrenheit of course. In my years of jogging the sidewalks of old town Fort Collins I have received many kind offers. These include fresh water, bandages, and vows never to park your lawn mowers and large vehicles in the sidewalk again. I thank you all for your consideration! \xa0 Unbeknownst to many of you, I am not just a jogger 24-7. I am a musician as well, and am proud to present the work entitled Cellophane Eyes. \xa0My good friend Sean Waters and I have spent about a year\'s time writing, arranging and recording this original work, a twelve song album of all original tunes composed by The Seers. \xa0We are a local grass roots project that has completed recording our album locally at Stout Studios, headed by sound engineer extraordinaire, Darren Radach. To support the project we have launched a thirty day campaign via kick starter. This includes a short yet comical video that combines blind jogging with a humorous way of promoting the new record. Even if you have little to no money to spend, I would hope for you all to take the time to watch this video and to see what Sean and I are up to with our original music. The Seers play songs that others have written for a living, but we want to share our own ideas too.\xa0\nSincerely,\nBrian Collins\n'

u"\n\nDithrandir TCG is a detailed and complex card game being built through the Unity engine. It will require a good amount of work to complete, but a good portion of it is also already done. What we're missing now is the art and programming to complete the work so that it has its own unique look. The game has nearly 180 cards currently and more are being added. We're looking to have approx 200 cards on release, or 250 if we reach a high enough goal, each with their own unique art. There will even be some special promotional cards for backers. There will be a multi-player and single-player aspect to the game, the ability to buy more card boosters via in-game currency or with real money. There may also be the possibility of a draft mode. The plan is to release the game mid-to-late spring of next year, or earlier if possible, for the PC and possibly for other consoles such as the WiiU or Xbox 360 if enough of a goal is reached. The concept is solid and has gone through plenty of testing, we just need your help to make it a reality.If you want an indepth discussion at how the game plays, check out Whiskey Reviews here -\xa0http://wskosc.blogspot.co.uk/2014/08/whiskey-recommends-dithrandir.html\n"

u'\n\nOutlineDithrandir TCG is a detailed and complex scifi trading card game being built through the Unity engine. It utilizes both your deckbuilding skills but also a luck of the roll, as rolling a six-sided die for different actions is an enormous part of the game concept.The game features 7 distinct races in the base set alone, 8 planets with multiple locations each, dozens of creatures, multiple starships and a broad array of equipment to use.\xa0The base set alone is planned to be opened with at least 200 cards, possibly more, with the ability to be able to make multiple deck types focusing on winning through different aspects of the game.Plans are to release the game by late Spring, with alpha and beta access in the months prior. Further details on the game and the goals are below.The Story3038 A.D. - Humans have begun exploring space, searching for new life and minerals. Earlier encounters with beings known as the Valdeth, a race of psychic beings that resembled human myths of dragons and sea serpents, gave humans the ability for interstellar travel. Humans have expanded and met multiple other races within their own galaxy since then.Within a nearby solar system, a planet was discovered that held no sentient life, but extensive amounts of mineral deposits instead that were similar to Earth\'s (now known at Terranis to the other races). There was another mineral that was not seen on Terranis, known as Dithrandir, therefore the planet was named after this mineral. Dithrandir had a unique quality, in that it emitted a non-lethal radiation that seemed to imbue other minerals, jewels in particular, with their own properties and turned them into power sources greater than had ever been seen. And so humans chose to colonize this planet, mining the gems and the Dithrandir to power various machines, including new starships that cut travel time between planets from several months to a mere few days.3061 A.D.\xa0- A little more than two decades have passed since Dithrandir was colonized, the population of the planet at a few million. Miners, scientists and their families makeup the majority of those that live on the planet. The new jewel-powered starships are the staple of the galaxy now and more and more of the Dithrandir mineral seems to be found every day.The people of the planet, however, have become increasingly paranoid of outsiders as the years went on. They began getting greedy, attempting to cut off trade with anyone not from their own world. They even called themselves Dithrans, stating that they were now a separate nation. Newborns on the planet were being born with a blue glow radiating from the hair on their bodies, a sign that they were saturated with radiation from the Dithrandir mineral as well.Years continued to pass and the Dithrans had started cutting off communications with everyone, claiming they would eliminate anyone that attempted to enter the planet\'s proximity with a new weapon they designed. It was known as the Armageddus Star, a \'planet-killer\' class weapon, created almost entirely out of the jewels and minerals found on the planet. This weapon caused their own demise as internal wars began on the planet for control of the mining facilities and finally for the weapon itself. It was triggered and sabotaged, tearing the planet up from the inside and causing it to explode. Only a handful of Dithrans managed to escape the calamity, now known as the Armageddus Incident, or A.I., entering the galaxy into a new age.A.I. 116\xa0- 116 years after the Incident, most of the galaxy is in chaos after the destruction of Dithrandir. Large masses of the planet flew across the galaxy, hitting other planets and either destroying them or causing devastation. Terranis itself was completely obliterated by one, now reduced to an unstable gravity field with shards of the planet flying wildly about within it. With many of these masses, came the Dithran radiation as well. When they struck a planet, the entire area around the impact zone even further was saturated in the radiation, which was now toxic to many lifeforms. Anything affected by the radiation would become a crazed beast and attack anything that was not their own kind, regardless of how passive they were prior. The galaxy has become a dark place to survive."We only have ourselves to blame. It\'s harsh and brutal and broken, but one still has to keep living somehow." ~Remni Strath, Captain of the StarburstThe GameDithrandir\'s base game type is a 2-player match. Each player has a 40 card minimum play deck, a Starship, and at least a 10 card Planet deck.\xa0The cards themselves all have various different stats on it depending on the card type. There\'s Starship, Crew, Creature, Equipment, Action and Planet cards. Each of the types have their own subtype, which can vary their use even further. For instance Equipment cards come in 4 varieties, Standard Equipment (no stats, only abilities for Crew), Weapon Equipment (combat stats and abilities for Crew), Jewel Equipment (bonus stats and abilities for Weapons and Starships), and Upgrade Equipment (no stats, only abilities for Starships). Each of the card types has their own colors to attribute it to it\'s main type and then a subtitle to explain which subtype it is. Here are a couple examples below using a new template we\'ve been working on.\n\nStarship Example\n\n\nPlanet Example\n\n\nCrew Example\n\n\nEquipment (Weapon) Example\n\nWinning a standard Dithrandir game can be met by multiple goals. You can destroy your opponent\'s ship, wipe out their whole crew or make it to the end of the designated rounds with the most Chakra (currency). Focusing on winning by one of these goal types and using the various methods to do so will be what diversifies the many possible deck types that can be created.For another indepth log at how the game plays, check out Whiskey Reviews here -\xa0http://wskosc.blogspot.co.uk/2014/08/whiskey-recommends-dithrandir.htmlGoalsThe purpose of the Kickstarter is to get the ground running on the engine and to hire artists, programmers and designers for the heavy work. There will be over 200 pieces of artwork that will need to be made for the game. We have at least 3 artists on standby, including Cynthia Turner, who drew the concept design for the Dargon race below:\n\nDargon Concept\n\nWe\'re currently in process of finding a couple programmers to contract for the game design in Unity, as well as an IT team to assist with running a server so that we can keep all the game information serverside. We\'ll need a web designer for a brand new website dedicated to the game as well and the funds to host the site as well. An infrastructure will be needed also for the purchasing of booster packs, whether it\'s through in-game currency or real world money, and even planning on including a way to edit your deck outside of the game itself incase we\'re able to do cross platform play of some sort.Any funding over the amount will go towards possible extra features, extra cards and artwork and if enough is given, an earlier port over other platforms.The End ResultOn release, we expect to include several game modes, including a Standard, Draft and Tournament mode. Players will be able to earn in-game currency through regular play and hitting certain goals, which can go towards purchasing more booster packs, new card backs and playmats, and the entry fee for some of the game modes. Booster packs will be sold at a premium with real world cash, planned between $2-3 a pack, each pack coming with 12 cards. Standard booster would come with 8 commons, 3 uncommons and 1 rare or cosmic quality card. The cost of the packs will be slightly higher with conversion using in-game currency.\xa0The game will have an extensive deck building system that should be accessible both in-game and on the game website, as well as being able to purchase packs using the same method. You\'ll be able to sort through every card by type, name, ability and stats, then build and save as many decks as you can imagine. There will also be a card collection database system so you can look at the cards you don\'t own yet and may even be a bonus for completing a full set of cards. To assist in that, we\'ll have a trading system setup as well, where you can trade any amount of cards you wish with another player using a double confirm system to ensure you wont be scammed.\xa0This is just the base of what will be in the works for the game in the long run. The more funding received, the more we can throw in.Contact InfoAt anytime you wish to ask more questions regarding the game, or even wish to try a short demo of the game in it\'s prototype form, feel free to contact me anytime with remni@live.com\n'

u'\nI have been making Home Made Soap\'s for a few years now but mainly on a very small time level... presents and gifts and for my own personal use. \xa0My soaps are made from 100% vegetable oils (Olive, Palm, Coco-nut primarily), Lye, and essential oils and pigment to create something both appealing to the eye and nose! \xa0Home made soap\'s are much better for you then the store brought things listed as "soap" Homemade soap is soap in its true form. \xa0It will gently clean away excess oils and bacteria but not strip away the natural oil\'s that your skin needs. \xa0Each of the oils I use in its creation all help restore the moisture that your skin needs to be healthy!Commercial store bought soaps are available everywhere for a very low prices. Some of them were marketed as deodorant soaps, and these could be especially drying to your skin. Soaps like these are better classified as detergents. You know, the stuff you use to wash your clothes and dishes because they strip the natural oils from your skin. They generally also include tons of preservatives, cheap synthetic fillers, and fragrances that can flare up allergies and sensitivities in some people.The alternative? Using handmade soap, or soaps with pure ingredients. Not only are they gentler than those harsh detergent bars, but they are usually much more moisturizing, come in a variety of scents, and last much longer than the average store bar.Natural soaps are made in a time-honored fashion. It involves a very simple chemical reaction between oils (or fats) and lye (sodium hydroxide for bars). All soap is made with lye, but there is no lye in the finished product. The chemical reaction(saponification) converts the lye/fat mixture to glycerin. The glycerin is a natural by-product and, as such, the relationship between the soap molecule and the glycerin means you have a cleanser with abundant, luxurious lather that cleans like nothing else. As a bonus, it does not strip your skin of its natural, protective oils.Commercially made soap usually contains detergents, fillers, chemicals, petroleum, high animal fat content (sodium tallowate) and irritants like SLS or. Commercially made soap tends to be less eco-friendly as well. While commercially manufactured soap usually costs less, the impact on your skin and the environment is shocking.Natural handmade soaps are made with natural oils, have high glycerin content, are better for the environment with no detergents, phosphates or sulfates, and are never tested on animals.\n'

u'\nI wish to go beyond selling my beautiful soaps on a small scale, and expand into other markets such as Etsy, craft fairs, shows, festivals, & who knows - maybe more?! I want to push forward on this worthy project and suceed! This requires some start-up money. Please read below & consider helping me in my new business endeavor? Hey, everyone needs soap! It may as well be wonderful soap.Well, I love life\'s simple pleasures & little luxuries ~~ don\'t you? What\'s better than a small, useful indulgence that feels good, IS GOOD, is totally affordable, AND is good for you? NOTHING! Even better when it is eco-friendly and handcrafted by *me* with love and care. My soap bars are just that. Currently available in Patchouli, Lavender, and Vanilla, (as well as Tea Tree Oil and Pine Tar). Will expand to include Sandalwood and Rose, and Citrus scents, in the future, and lot\'s more.\xa0You probably already know this: but homemade soap is so much better for your skin than the cheap, commercially-available soap. Usually, those national brands are nothing more than a detergent (similar to grease-cutting dish soap and scum-cutting laundry detergents) added to artificial smelly stuff - & maybe a plop of chemical moisturizer AFTER it has already damaged your skin! Sure they "clean"... but they also strip your skin mantle of necessary, much-needed oils & beneficial bacterium that should always exist there. Plus, they often contain tons of chemicals that can trigger irritations.Trust me, you don\'t want that!\xa0I must admit, my first pursuits in the art of ~Soap Making~ all started for my own personal use. I prefer to use natural products that are both good for me AND the environment. Soon, friends were clamoring to own my wonderful soaps for themselves. Not such a bad problem to have!\xa0My friends & I greatly enjoy my pleasingly scented, eco-friendly, skin-friendly, frothy lather-producing, nicely long-lasting, handmade soaps! All of my early customers love my products ~ I know you will, too.\xa0A little extra detail:\xa0Like all dedicated, traditional soap artisans who value a quality product over ease or cheapness of manufacture: I use the ancient "lye method" similar to that used by the very first soap makers in 2800 BC Babylonia, and throughout history in many nations. While the word "lye" may be surprising for a skin product, I assure you that there are ZERO caustic agents left behind in the finished product. The lye totally goes away when it does its chemical/science thing(saponification), and only leaves behind a pure, gentle, skin-loving, moisture-enhancing, high-glycerin-content luxury soap.If you are ever bothered by detergents, fillers, chemicals, petroleum, high animal fat content (sodium tallowate), irritants like SLS, & large eco-footprints left by common soap mega-companies, you will really appreciate what I make. I use 100% vegetable oils - mainly: olive, palm, & coconut - plus fragrant, natural, essential oils & pigments to create something appealing to all of the senses! Never, ever tested on animals.Help me bring my fantastic soap to the public?Thanks & Love,Deryk\xa0\n'

u'\nI am an active supporter in the dog rescue community, and have rescued huskies personally. \xa0Throughout these experiences and meeting many dogs, there has always been one consistent issue: \xa0Taking pills. \xa0One of my huskies (Maggie. \xa07y/old Siberian) has Lymes and must take 3 pills a day, for 30 days, twice a year. \xa0That is 90 pills in 30 days! \xa0That is a TON of expensive pill pockets (which don\'t really work anyway). \xa0So, I reverted to the old "peanut butter on a spoon" trick. \xa0Only to find that she was too smart for me, and licked around the spoon, leaving me with messy hands, a dirty spoon, and a wasted pill. \xa0I thought there had to be a better way and I think I have discovered it. \xa0Fully-edible, organic spoon-shaped dog treats! \xa0The newest way to give your loved dog his/her medicine. \xa0Simply scoop some PB on the spoon, put the pill in the peanut butter, and then watch as your pet effortlessly, and cleanly, takes their meds by eating the entire treat! \xa0There are 2 different variations: \xa0wheat based and non-wheat based. \xa0This product comes in salmon and chicken flavored and is patent-pending. \xa0The funds are needed to pursue production on a mass scale. \xa0We have veterinarian offices interested in using the product, as well as local pet stores. \xa0However capital to fulfill the amount of orders we have is coming up short, which is where you come in!. \xa0Please join in helping some of the most helpless in our lives live better, cleaner, healthier lives. \xa0Our treats are 100% organic, no preservatives and include apples, rice flour, organic peanut butter, sweet potato, rolled oats (salmon oil or turkey broth depending on flavor) and water. \xa0Don\'t hesitate to email any questions and be sure to check out my 2 huskies snacking away at them in the video for proof that they work and are tasty!\n'

u'\nGiving pills to dogs can be a daunting task.  My product aims to make this process not only simple, but healthy and clean for your pup, (and you)!  This patent pending, spoon-shaped dog treat aims to solve common problems such as wasted products, reluctance with dogs to take their meds, messy spoons, dirty dishes and hours sometimes days or preparation while adding in a huge dose of fun!  It is a very simple concept.  People love giving their dogs treats.  It is second to only baseball for America\'s favorite pastime.  People use treats to hide the medicine that most dogs absolutely reject.  Dog owners routinely will use the classic "peanut butter on the spoon" trick.  Every dog owner has heard of this, most if not all have tried it.  This method is in every household with a dog today!  My twist, is simply making a recognizable object, into a full, fun-sized organic edible treat!  Instead of licking the peanut butter off the spoon and keeping your fingers crossed your pup will eat the pill(s) inside, now they will consume the entire treat!  This can also be used as a novelty item, niche gift, special occasion, or an "anytime" treat!  At the same time reducing the need to wash dishes, get hands dirty or waste pills!  The alternatives such as "pill pockets" on the market are not organic, all-natural and who knows what is really in them.  Not only this, but they are NOT a multi-prong approach and can be VERY EXPENSIVE!  They only serve one purpose, and not very effectively.  Just read the negative reviews and frustrations from people who don\'t like them.  Doggables! is the answer to these problems while also serving as an "anytime" treat for all dogs, regardless of medication needs. \xa0Just check out the video below for more proof how this works! \xa0Pledge today so that we can start mass production to fill all the orders we have! \xa0We need to buy more supplies, hire more bakers and demand is increasing. \xa0Just $5 bucks gets your dog or the family dog a entry to win one of 20 spots to appear on our packaging and marketing!\n'

u"\nThe project and the about me really go hand in hand since I am the project. With the game of golf I have had more downs than ups with this game yet still cling to the possibility that I could play this game at the highest level. Right now with the cost of a good set of clubs being so high and working nights on an hourly wage it really doesn't cover the cost of being able to purchase them. This would be the first step on my road to becoming a Tour Professional. With the new set of clubs I would be able to start getting my golf game in order again. The reason I do not have clubs at the moment was that I was working at a golf course but with cost of living being so high all my money went to bills and food with one particularly bad month and unexpected bills I had to sell my golf clubs. My main goal is being able to acquire a sponsor to start playing the professional mini tours. These are also very expensive being you might need $40-50,0000 for year covering cost of living, play/practice time, traveling, coaching etc.... any money I receive over the cost of the equipment will go to pay for tournaments etc..\xa0 I am 33 years old, and have had a roller coaster of a time with golf in my life. I didn't get into the game till I was about 18. I got my handicap very low in my early 20s and did not play in college. I started playing the mini tours in Southern California when my then ex girlfriend decided to steal everything I own and leave me penniless. I decided to move out to AZ where my family was and start over, another time in my life where I had no golf clubs the game was forgotten for the next 7 years where I got into sales. What brought me back was when I went out and shot 71 first time on a golf course in almost a decade. I quit my sales job and got a job at a golf course. Playing and practicing I was able to get my game down to a +3 handicap and shooting mid 60s to low 70s consistently. The problem was that I had no money for tournaments and no contacts for a sponsor. Now here I am today, I gave up on golf over a year ago frustrated but it has never left my mind. I watch the television coverage every week dreaming I was there. This is pretty much one of my last shots at doing something. Thank you very much!\n"

This matter becomes very troubling for people when health care of a nature which they do not desire and which they feel harms them is forced upon them in courts of law. It therefore appeared like a worthwhile venture to me to promote the concept of natural health care and natural mental health care as human rights in my online reporting for DrMandelNews.com. This news service also has a focus on exposing mental health care human rights abuses. General interest online reporting is also offered with an interest in encouraging a holistic approach to well being wherein entertainment and an awareness of what is going on in the world around you are seen as being essential to your overall well being. DrMandelNews.com can be found online at http://www.drmandelnews.com\n'
Current:
u'\nWhen the Internet first began to take off I became fascinated by what this development could do for health care and I created "Dr Harold Mandel Online". It is my objective to use high tech to be able to offer people across the United States and worldwide access to up to date information about health care and wellness counseling health care services. With a deep appreciation for what a complementary approach to health care can offer I focus a great deal of efforts on offering the latest information about natural health care alongside information about general health care via DrMandelNews.com. With a deep appreciation for many reports by patients of human rights abuses associated with the provision of mental health care by psychiatrists I also focus much of my reporting on such human rights issues. I have also developed "The Harold Mandel, MD Natural Mental Health Care Reform Association" to offer ongoing support for victims of mental health care human rights abuses. And with an interest in offering the public easy access to high quality natural health care products online I have also developed DrMandelMall.com as part of what Dr Harold Mandel Online offers. \n'

u'\nEvery day I see fresh young minds walk past me. People that have the ability to do something great... yet... are so sucked in by society and it\'s ritual norms. "Go to school, get good grades, get a good job and continue on the family name." Now don\'t get me wrong, those are good things to strive for. BUT people strive to hard and fall off the path that they strolled as a child.The older you get, the less in-tune with art, music, reading and writing you become. Yes, you listen to these things and you every once in awhile will pick up a guitar, play a quick drum solo, draw a few lines or write a few paragraphs. But how often do you actually do that?This project is to create a Mural, at the center of another project in Waterford. That tethers two very large and popular Plazas together. The project runs a scenic side walk from one plaza, under a bridge and to the other plaza. I have gotten permission to paint both sides of this under pass with inspirational art in the form of Graffiti. With this, I want to open peoples minds of all ages to the beauty of art, the words of writing, the notes of music and try to inspire them in the ways that they had as a child. To restore a connection to the creative, inventive and exploratory side of the mind.\xa0\n'

This newly rectified Art instillation will be a focal point to be viewed from the River.  We want to bring people together in order to share something long lasting and beautiful for our community.\xa0The location we have been given responsibility of, is a central point that connects two of the largest shopping plazas in our township. This popular canoe route and fishing area is well known throughout Waterford, especially by those living in the retirement community and condominiums nearby. \nOur goal is to clean up and resurrect a beautiful pathway that has been neglected for too long.  We wish to bring inspiration to our community by creating a cultural art counterpoint in a well-traveled area that all ages can enjoy.

u'\nI have been living my life taking care of people and I am scare that life will pass me by without me living life and not getting to do something for me. I am really a basic girl that is not about the newest purse of what the latest fashion is. I have always been someone that craved to go back to a simple sort of life. I wanted to be on a piece of land somewhere living off the grid the best way I saw fit. I want to learn things I want to grow things. I want to go back to basics. From my homesteading up to this point it is a learn experience for sure. Some times you will do a project and you sit and think well I could have done that another way or what ever the case might be and you learn as you go. I know my homestead is not like others but that is what make us all different the freedom to live as we all see fit and I am just looking to be able to once live for myself and do what I want to do and I have only asked for a dollar because anything is better than what I started out with towards this project. I will be sharing everything I do so you at home can learn how to grow and produce food organically without the chemicals that seem to be everywhere. I hope to start a community garden were I can give the extra food grow to the local soup kitchens and food banks \xa0 so thanks for taking the time to read this\xa0\n'

u'\nMy project description would be more of a dream. My dream\nhas been my dream since I was a child. I wanted to have a yard and grow and\nhave livestock. But life is funny before you know it the years have passed you\nby and you were waiting for life to start and did not know life was already\nstarted. That is how I feel I was living life. I thought wow life is going to\npass me by without me doing all the things I wanted to do such as homesteading.\nI have never been one to want the newest purse or fancy rings. I have always\nbeen a basic woman that enjoys the simple things in life. About 3 years ago I\nstarted a small garden in my back yard in containers to test out if I could\ngrow things. I have learned that not only could I grow things I did it very\nwell and it was something I enjoyed more than anything else. So because I\nwanted to keep track of how well my garden was coming I started snapping photos\nand short little update videos of the process and posting them on my\nyoutube.\xa0 So I did that for about a year\nwhen I started posting them I thought no one would watch my videos\xa0 so it was done with the worst quality and low\nbudget camera in my cell as I did not own a camera and I had to use the only\nthing I had on hand.\xa0 But the more videos\nI would post the more views I would get . Then the comments and I realized that\nmakes me happy to be able to show people that yeah you can not only learn to\ngrow and do things for yourself but you can do it on a frugal budget. Because I\nhave been poor every day of my life and I am sure at this point Its really all\nI am comfortable with. Sure I would love not to worry if I can pay the lights\nnext month but who doesn\u2019t wish for those things.I want to be able to rebuild a homestead or if not a\nhomestead my garden again. I was told this year that I could use as much of my\nfriends 94 acres as I needed to have my dream. So I broke the golden rule my\ngrandmother warned me about my entire life about not putting all my eggs in one\nbasket. Because that is just what I did, as I moved every to the homestead land\nand spent weeks getting ready for the gardening season, Building green houses,\nbuilding homes for the animals. Tilling and planting so many things. \xa0When it did not work out with the friendship I\nlost everything and now need to start over\n'

u'\n\ne-striker nano\n\n\nconcept\n\n\nhow it clips to you fishing rod\n\nAs a designer and inventor i was taught to do extensive research before coming out with a product. Most of my creative thinking happens when i am driving or when i am isolated in my own world of thoughts. I always think how to solve a problem and how to make it better, but most important how to deliver an excellent product and how the end user will benefit from it. As a pastime one of my favorite things to do is to go fishing in the mountains and experience the wonderful things we have. On one of my fishing trips, i noticed that some people were using bells, glow in the dark gadgets, etc.. to detect a strike on their poles. Well that is all good but when you get a strike you have to attend and remove the gadgets making it a time consuming agenda. Therefore i decided to create a device that will attend those issues.I named the product (e-striker nano) As a starving inventor and with my knowledge as a designer i can reach so far, that is why i am reaching out to all the "kick-starter " fans, members and non-members, if my project gets funded successfully i will personally ensure that the product i will create is top notch. I already have a Chinese manufacture in stand by ready for production. Through long and excessive back and forth emails with Mr. Kono Lau form the Chinese manufacture (Shenzhen Timebolong Co.,Ltd) the only thing that is holding us back is the funding of this project.My intentions with (e-striker nano) is to put at least one on the hands of every fishermen out there, i intend to sell on my own website, sell to mom&pop stores, attend fishing conventions and most important to approach big companies like ; Bass-pro, Cabela\'s, Big5, Sport-Chalet, Walmart, etc..I am not done, this will be a stepping stone to the future, i already have other products lined up on the drawing table.

u'\nMOTIVATION\xa0The book Frack this!\xa0is motivated for a simple reason, to inform the public about why human-caused earthquakes occur and what and who causes them. When published in July 2014 it will be the only nonfiction book available on this topic\xa0providing answers resulting from research of leading scientists around the world.The idea to promote the fracking technology in order to become more independent from foreign natural gas is a one-sided view of the solution for the global energy dilemma. The only way to avoid future human-caused earthquake disasters is to educate the public.The public is very often unaware of the risks of living close to fracking facilities, mines, water reservoirs, and other geoengineering projects. Not even students in science and engineering classes are comprehensively taught that mines, water reservoirs, deep geothermal power plants, oil/gas production, and agricultural irrigation can cause earthquakes. Governments and leading corporations do not want to tackle this topic and oftentimes choose to ignore it. Without opposing any of these technologies rather than illuminating associated risks, this book provides knowledge for everyone who is affected by or wants to know more about earthquakes caused by humans.\n'

u'\nFlashInterview is a website that connects job seekers with employers using actual video taped interviews.\xa0 These unedited, professional interviews are done by Human Resource professionals, are fairly short in duration (up to 6 minutes) and allow job seekers to be "seen" by more employers than any other job seeking method.\xa0Employers can search the catalog, narrowing by many options, and watch interviews from many candidates quickly and cost effectively.\xa0 Employers are able to contract job seekers directly, forward the video link or comment.\xa0 Funds are being raised to develop the infrastructure of the site, logistics of video sites and advertising.\xa0 \n'
Current:
u'\nFlashInterview.com is going to change how the hiring process is done.\xa0 We are excited and commited to this goal.\xa0 We seek to virtually eliminate the resume as the sole source of matching people with employers. Our\r\ngoal is to make having a FlashInterview just as common as having a LinkedIn\r\naccount and much more important. It not\r\nonly gives job seekers the power to get themselves in front of hiring managers,\r\nbefore anyone else, it also allows them to track how often they are being\r\nseen.\xa0 Based\r\non a pilot program, done at a local college, our candid, uncut videos were\r\ngiven great reviews by Human Resource professionals.\nWhile the main focus of FlashInterview.com\r\nis an unedited interview by an HR professional, we didn\u2019t want to stop\r\nthere.We added all of the other \u201cbells\r\nand whistles\u201d of other job sites.The\r\nuser (Job Candidate) will be able to send their video, add keywords,\r\nschool/degrees, past positions held, travel preferences, expertise and\r\nsummary.We also capture statistics for\r\nthe user.These statistics include:How many times their link was sent; How many\r\ntimes their video was reviewed; How many times their video was \u201cverified\u201d by\r\nthe hiring company.Once our pilot\r\nprogram was complete, the test candidates were very excited and eager to start\r\nsending their FlashInterview out to hiring companies.Although our pilot program was at no cost,\r\nparticipants felt there was a real value to having the video done and plan on\r\nkeeping their video \u201cactive\u201d even if they were not seeking a new position.Initially our main focus was to help job\r\nseekers.They needed a way to become\r\nmore than just a piece of paper on a desk. Once we solved that problem, it\r\nbecame clear to us, there is another problem.Hiring managers simply do not have the time to schedule and meet\r\neveryone that applies to a position.In\r\nfact, a survey we conducted shows less than 2% of applicants actually get\r\nscheduled for an interview.Our survey\r\nalso revealed that many hiring managers got frustrated when hours were spent\r\ngoing through resumes, scheduling an interviews and meeting candidates just to\r\nfind out within 5 minutes that they were not the right fit.So, we developed the FlashInterview.com web\r\nsite as a portal for hiring managers to be able to search for candidates and,\r\nat their leisure, without scheduling, without the hassle, review as many\r\ninterviews as they like.FlashInterview.com will save companies thousands of dollars and hours\r\nper year.\n'

Change Everything.Over and over we hear Jesus, the greatest leader who has ever lived - a leader people STILL strive to follow today - say, "Follow Me"."Follow Me" is a book for leaders, but it is so much more. \xa0This is a book for you. \xa0It will inspire and empower you to step out. \xa0When you think of a leader, you think of CEOs, Coaches, Teachers, Politicians, Pastors. \xa0It\'s time to rethink your definition of a leader. \xa0These people alone cannot change the world. \xa0If they could, the world would be a very different place. \xa0"Follow Me" is a part of my Just One project - a one on one discipleship and personal growth project that is changing lives RIGHT NOW. \xa0There was a need for a leadership book that could serve as the launchpad for new leaders - and still stand just as effectively as the final stage in teaching others to lead.When I watch my children in their everyday lives, I see leaders. \xa0When I see an older lady come alongside a frazzled young mother, I see a leader. \xa0When I walk through the local WalMart, I see leaders all around me. \xa0The problem is, very few of them know how to lead. \xa0Go on a journey with me.How do I know it works? \xa0Because we\'re doing it every day at Victory Fellowship. \xa0In nine languages and counting.Follow Me.Change Everything.\n'

u'\nNew App "Fishing Spot" is a Niche Social Media Platform for Fishing Enthusiasts\nIf you are like many passionate anglers, you love to share about your latest monster catch.  The new app "Fishing Spot" allows you to do just that. "Fishing Spot" is a new mobile application for iOS and Android devices will permit users to upload photos of their catch, a short caption and the coordinates of where the catch occurred.  This amazing new app has the potential to unify the global amateur fishing community.\nThe concept for "Fishing Spot" was conceived of by Atlas Greyfox, an Australian retiree who is also an avid amateur fisherman. He has partnered with AppXperts PTY/LTD to develop "Fishing Spot" into a commercially successful product for mobile phone users around the world.  Atlas\u2019 brilliant idea has the potential to create powerful new relationships within the amateur fishing community, facilitate marketing and promotion by related fishing products companies and vacation spots, and offer guidance to newcomers to the sport.\nWhile the potential for "Fishing Spot" is immense, this project is not yet complete. In order to raise the funds to make this concept a reality, Atlas Greyfox has sponsored a fundraising campaign on Kickstarter .  If you are like millions of other passionate fishers, you can recognize the promise of "Fishing Spot"; please consider making a generous financial contribution to this historically important project which could help revolutionize this centuries old sport.\nI Thank you all and Kickstarter very much for your help.\xa0\n'

u'\nWhat our fans are sayingPaula Tovar: "I\'m officially addicted to Choc Fru"\n\n\nThe Chocolate StoryWe\'re in Colombia - the land of chocolate but guess what: there is no organic chocolate.HUHHHHH? Exactly what we thought.We\n rallied round some friends, called some shops and saw pretty quickly \nthere was a huge demand for high-end, great-tasting organic chocolate.\n\n\nWithin a matter of only a few days, we\'d sold about 100 bars and received interest from a couple of shops.\nBut sadly, we had to import cacao butter and powder from abroad to make the first couple of batches of chocolate.Why? Because we didn\'t have the grinder.\xa0 Despite organic cacao beans being grown here we couldn\'t get the cacao nibs fine enough with our food processor.\n\n\nWith this grinder, we can make great tasting organic chocolate using only the beans (and not powder and butter).\xa0 Without the machine, we can\'t make great-tasting chocolate.\xa0 And to have success, we\'re going to need to obsess about this.About Choc Fru\n\n\nI\'m Adrian. I\'ve lived off and on in Colombia for 7 years. Previously I lived in the UK, where I started up a tuition business.\xa0 It\'s been successful but tuition is not my true passion.\xa0 Colombia and chocolate are my real loves and I\'m determined to develop a chocolate bar people absolutely adore.\xa0 I also want to have a positive impact on the lives of 100\'s of Colombians.I\'m heading to Ecuador and Costa Rica in November for 2 months to get a better understanding of how to make organic chocolate.\xa0 I\'ve got a pretty good idea, but I want to see how our neighbors in other countries do it and apply those principles here.\n\n\nI\'m Ciro. I\'m from Colombia. I love chocolate and I know how much other people love it. I have made chocolate bars that friends have enjoyed and asked more of.\xa0My passion is health and well-being: in body and mind and all the other stuff we are made of. I\'ve been contributing to this be-well cause through teaching yoga and meditation, giving time, money, smiles and even some massages :).\xa0Now, I want to put the same principles into making really wholesome organic chocolate bars that connect the generous, caring hands of the farmers with the joyful mouths of chocolate lovers.\xa0One of my dreams is that with this project we can have a\xa0positive\xa0impact on the life of cacao growers\xa0and\xa0their families and can offer people chocolate we are truly proud of.Why We Need Your Help\nIn order for us to move forward with this project we need the Santha Cacao wet grinder.\xa0 Without it, the quality of the chocolate won\'t be good enough.\xa0 We want people to absolutely love Choc Fru.\xa0 Go to www.chocfru.com to register for our newsletter or follow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/chocfru\n'

As the \xa0player explores the map they will find clues and evidence of what crimes this gang has committed, and discover were the true location of the gangs hideout is.Platform: PC (Windows 7)I got inspiration for the game from a popular game called Gone Home which I found has had great success, and I hope to have success with my game. I would say the game is more for casual gamer\'s but, other gamer\'s may like the game as well..Potential sales: I hope this game will be a great success and at least sell over 50,000 copies within the first month (as Gone Home did) maybe more as the months progress. I looked into Gone Home\'s sales figures and they managed to sell 50,000 copies within the first month so I would like to also hit this target.Story line; A detective is investigating a murder which took place in his own flat, by a group of thugs known as the Skull Banger\'s (who killed his wife.)\xa0A few months down the line, the detective gets a note from his contacts up north who tell him that they think they\'ve tracked down the Skull Banger\'s who killed his family.\nThe note reads\xa0"Dear Mick,\xa0my team up north believe we have found where the Skull Banger\'s may be hiding out.

u'\nGang\nInvestigators\nIntroductionThis\nis my kickstarter that I have created for a new and upcoming game\nthat I myself am currently in the process of creating, however, I am\nin desperate need of funding for software to make the game visually\nappealing as I am using outdated software. I am hoping that with the\nhelp of the community this project can become a huge success.StoryThe\nstory revolves around Mick, a detective who has witnessed a homicide\nthat is yet to be solved, the victim was his wife. The culprits are a\ngang of thugs known by the name of The Skull Bangers. The Skull\nBangers had forced Mick to watch as they murdered his wife in his own\nhome. Mick is determined to bring the Skull Bangers to justice and\nthis is where your adventure begins. Mick receives a note\nfrom Alan, one of his contacts, who may have located the Skull\nBangers\' true hideout, the note reads:\n "Dear\nMick, my team up north believe we have found where the Skull Banger\'s\nmay be hiding out. My sources tell me that they gather at night time,\nat an old pub which doesn\'t show up on any maps. To get there you\njust need to go to the main entrance of the forest and walk straight\nahead, until you arrive at the pub. \nFrom\nAlan P.S.\nI strongly recommend that you wait for my team, they\nwill be able to join you in 2 weeks\u2019 time to help catch them. Do\nnot do it alone." \nThe\nstory will unravel as you find and piece together evidence that may\nhelp you locate the Skull Bangers\' hideout. As you gain more evidence\nthe plot becomes more intriguing and will pull you into the world of\nthis murder mystery and uncover the reasons behind why Mick and his\nwife were targeted by this cruel gang and why Mick still lives\u2026Game play:\xa0The\nplayer will play the role of Mick, the detective investigating the\nmurder of his wife. Gang Investigators is a first person point and\nclick adventure where the player can interact with the environment\nusing the mouse and keyboard.

I am in need of help to get the funding to go\ntowards getting the production started and also getting all of the right documents\nor licenses\xa0. I know this will be a hit in stores and venues, as they were hot ticket items sold from my food trailer. A lot of\npeople love eating regular\xa0Hushpuppies but you just got to try these with the different\nflavors everyone enjoys them. \xa0No matter what kind of event you have these will go great. So whatever you can do to help this project to get off the ground we surely appreciate it.\n\nMac and Cheese Hushpuppies\n\n\xa0We also have Enchilada, Brisket, Pizza, Vegetarian ,Smoke turkey\xa0Hushpuppies\xa0the list goes on 32 different\xa0flavors.\n\nHUSHPUPPIES!!!!\n\n'
Current:
u'\n\n\nThese gourmet hushpuppies were born in my very own kitchen one sunny afternoon in central Texas. I\u2019ve always loved to cook. Creating my very own recipes and watching people enjoy is one of the greatest feelings in the world.  \nWhile preparing to open a food trailer and orchestrating various catering events, the idea of adding flavors into hushpuppies came to me. It packed everything into one little punch.\xa0Meat: Check\xa0Spice: Check\nFried Doughy Goodness: Check Goes Great with a Brew and Some Good Friends: DOUBLE CHECK!!\xa0I spent some time mastering different flavor combinations and taking polls from friends and family before deciding on 5 mainstay flavors for the food trailer.  Enchilada, Shrimp, Jalapeno and Bacon, Mac & Cheese, Brisket, and Italian. Each puppie flavor came with it\u2019s own dipping sauce and would be sold as a meal. They look innocent, however just a few will fill you up!\nOpen weekend was a huge success! However, there were some challenges along the way. Rain, mud, and extreme heat! Making fried goodies in a 8\u2019x10\u2019 box in 100 degree heat with no A/C will run it\u2019s toll on anyone. (Not to mention the refrigerator.)\xa0What I needed was a more efficient way of getting these amazing hushpuppies into the hands of hungry patrons. Having a restaurant location would be ideal, but something kept pulling me towards mass production. As I talked with customers at the trailer we all agreed that these would be top notch at sports bars, music festivals, baseball parks, as appetizers or just to pop in the oven at home for family movie night.\xa0I started to look into places to mass produce these puppies and made some connections with local pubs and owners to discuss the idea. I feel that the hushpuppies can make their debut as specialty items inside venues and once people taste them and start to love them, they\u2019ll be a sure sell in stores like Randall\u2019s, HEB and even Wal-Mart\u2019s frozen food section.\n\nMac and Cheese Hushpuppies\n\nWhy I Need Funding:\nThere are many little details that go into mass producing food products, from packaging, to recipe cost, nutritional breakdown and all the proper licenses and documents. I\u2019m looking for help with the initial investment so that I can produce enough product to keep up demand and supply while Kickstarting the other objectives of this project like the grocery store contracts.\n\nHUSHPUPPIES!!!!\n\nNot Just the Funding:\nI realize that getting big time contracts with stores like Wal-Mart will not be an easy task. That\u2019s also why I need your help. I\u2019m looking for people outside of Austin to recognize how delicious these puppies are and help me get the word out so that making the proper contracts with big stores seems more like a reality along the way.\xa0And did I mention before I tried dozens of flavor combinations.. some work, some don\u2019t. I polled friends and family, but I\u2019d also love to hear from you.\xa0What sounds good? What would you buy?\nVegetarian? Say.. Tomato, Cilantro and Black Bean?\nPizza?  Just Cheese and sauce? Or Pepperoni too?\nSmoked Turkey?  I did have a turkey and broccoli version which was very well received, but the shelf life was short. (This is also something that can be conquered with mass production.) \n'

u"\nNEW(2)! I've just posted some Python code! https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1937541932/gpio-xmas-tree-kit-for-the-raspberry-pi/postsNEW! Now shipping Worldwide! (Hoping to ship very early in December, but please understand that I can't guarantee arrival before Xmas for international orders, sorry)Hello! The Raspberry Pi is a great device for learning about controlling hardware and, like many of you out there, I've enjoyed connecting LEDs to the GPIO pins and controlling them with Python.I had the idea to make a fun, festive GPIO project for the Pi and also to try out an interesting LED-interfacing technique called 'Charlieplexing'. The result is the GPIO Xmas Tree for the Raspberry Pi!If you look-up Charlieplexing on Wikipedia then you may think it's an intimidating technique but, really,\xa0it's quite simple. It has one big advantage: you can connect lots of LEDs to a small number of GPIO pins. My Xmas tree uses just four GPIO pins to control 7 LEDs (although\xa0four pins could drive as many as 12 LEDs!). I'll explain all about Charlieplexing in the updates as the campaign progresses and also in the final instructions, but don't worry if it sounds complicated: I'll provide plenty of examples of Python code that will make it easy.Why do I need your help?

u"\n>>> 'Stretch Goal' announced... see below!! <<<Hello! The Raspberry Pi is a great device for learning about controlling hardware and, like many of you out there, I've enjoyed connecting LEDs to the GPIO pins and controlling them with Python.I had the idea to make a fun, festive GPIO project for the Pi and also to try out an interesting LED-interfacing technique called 'Charlieplexing'. The result is the GPIO Xmas Tree for the Raspberry Pi!If you look-up Charlieplexing on Wikipedia then you may think it's an intimidating technique but, really,\xa0it's quite simple. It has one big advantage: you can connect lots of LEDs to a small number of GPIO pins. My Xmas tree uses just four GPIO pins to control 7 LEDs (although\xa0four pins could drive as many as 12 LEDs!). I'll explain all about Charlieplexing in the updates as the campaign progresses and also in the final instructions, but don't worry if it sounds complicated: I'll provide plenty of examples of Python code that will make it easy.Why do I need your help? I think this is a fun project that many Pi-owners will enjoy, whether they just want a fun Christmas gizmo to solder, or whether they want to learn about Charlieplexing. However, PCBs are expensive to produce in small quantities and I need your help to place a big enough order to get the cost of the kit into the 'pocket money' price range (low-cost 'pocket money' electronics kits are a big project of mine at the moment: see my project at www.pocketmoneytronics.co.uk )\n \nThe PCB you see in the photo and video is very nearly the finished version: there's just a few small tweaks to be made that will help with soldering and programming.>>> STRETCH GOAL <<< We're getting very close to 200% funding! If we hit that value (i.e. \xa31080) then, as well as the yellow LED at the top of the tree, I'll include a 'bi-colour' LED which can be used in this position (read on for a few limitations, though). I've been experimenting with a nice Red/Green LED which can be red or green or, if you flick quickly between the two, a funny mixture of the two colours. There's a small limitation, though: the bicolour LED is slightly dimmer than the other red LEDs. This can be compensated for to some extent by modifying the software so that the bi-colour LED is illuminated for slightly longer in the sequence than the red LEDs and, consequently, I'd suggest its of most interest to more advanced experimenters (I'll post a suggestion to something that the less brave users can do with this LED instead, though!). It's just a little something to say 'thank you' for supporting this Kickstarter and making this project happen!News regarding Charlieplexing: here's a video I've made about how the Charlieplexing works http://youtu.be/57wRBMdOm9U\xa0or you can read about Charlieplexing in this Kickstarter update: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1937541932/gpio-xmas-tree-kit-for-the-raspberry-pi/posts/1037203News regarding kit multipack: I've now added the option of 2 kits for \xa310 for UK backers... please feel free to update/adjust your pledge to take advantage of this option! ;-) If you're one of the kind people who has already bid a multiple of \xa36 for multiple kits, please contact me and I'll arrange something so that you're not out of pocket.NEW!

u'\nIt is hard to be an Egyptian vulture nowadays. How we know this? Well, we have found Egyptian vultures dead under electric poles. We\u2019ve seen Egyptian vultures poisoned. We\u2019ve observed how the point from the satellite is \u201cfloating\u201d in the middle of the sea with no hope to reach the shore (because there are not enough adult birds to lead the younger ones). We are aware of birds which lost their babies to poachers had stolen their eggs...\r\n\r\nToday Egyptian vulture is one of the species at the edge of extinction. That\u2019s why we cannot leave to chance even the natural selection. During the period from the returning of the adult birds to their nests until the flying of the young birds to sough, we watch their nests. We are there when adult birds repair the nests. We are there when they start nesting. Of course we do not miss the moment when baby birds hatch. The following few months are really important for them. They must grow up and become strong enough to manage to fly and reach their wintering grounds.The Egyptian vulture is on the top of the food chain. It helps to maintain the balance in nature. For example the decreasing the number of the vultures, increases the number of the predators on the ground which may spread diseases such as rabies.Currently, there are about 70 pairs of Egyptian Vultures in the Balkans and this number decreases each year.\xa0This film will highlight the Egyptian Vulture, its struggles, and its victories. Filming has already begun, and we need that little extra push to complete it.\n'
Current:
u'\nThe Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus) is the smallest of the four species of European vultures. Its small size (wingspan of 180 cm (5.9 ft.) and body length of 60 cm (2.2 ft.)) have lead to its other Bulgarian name: \u2018lesser vulture\u2019. The adults have white plumage with black flight feathers and featherless yellow-orange face. The crest of white, pointed feathers gives the bird its typical appearance. The tail is white and wedge-shaped. The young are dark brown with light feather tips. As they mature the dark juvenile feathers are gradually replaced with the typical white of the adults. The bird reaches adult plumage in its fifth or sixth year. In flight it can be mistaken for a white stork. The differences are the wedge-shaped tail and the short legs and neck.\n\nThe ancient Egyptians revered it as a sacred being and even gave it a special hieroglyph in their writing. It was considered the symbol of Isis, goddess of fertility, motherhood and magic. She was often depicted with spread wings. Back in ancient times the Egyptian vulture nested on the pyramids in Giza and have been depicted on several hieroglyphs. Another interesting artifact, also found during excavations was a bronze figurine of the Ancient Greek goddess Aphrodite with a hat in the form of an Egyptian vulture. The bird is also seen in the form of statues and fountains that were discovered in the Afitos region on the Halkidiki Peninsula in Greece. It was celebrated also as a herald of spring much in the same way as we celebrate the arrival of storks and swallows today. This marks it as a species which has always existed in a close relation with man.\n\nEgyptian Vulture in Eygptian History\n\nMuslims from the Eastern Rhodope Mountains in Bulgaria still recall the legend of the \u2018akbuba\u2019, \u2018the white father\u2019, who rescued the Prophet Muhammad from the grasp of a golden eagle. The Prophet expressed his gratitude by giving it eternal life and endowed it with its white plumage \u2013 a symbol of purity and bravery.\xa0\n\nEgyptian Vultures being fed by the monks from Tirukalukundram Temple, India\n\nA temple in Tirukalukundram, India.The word Thirukazhukundram comes from the Tamil words Thiru \r\n(Respectful), Kazhugu (Eagle), Kundram (mount). It was known as \r\n"Thirukazhugukundram" in ancient times, which, overtime became \r\nThirukazhukundram. The town is also known as Pakshi Theertham (Bird\'s \r\nHoly Lake) for its pair of vultures which has come to nest here for centuries. Every day before noon the birds come to the temple to receive a daily gift of food from the monks. The holy men believe that if they do not show up in time there is a sinner among their midst who needs to repent. Legend also has it that the vultures represent eight sages who were punished by Shiva with two of them leaving in each of a series of epochs.The Egyptian vulture is also praised and revered on Socotra Island. Located at the entrance of the Gulf of Aden, the Egyptian vulture has flourished and has been left, undisturbed as it walks amongst the islands\' residents as a sign of protected reverence.In many places in Africa the vultures are not disturbed by human presence, but, unfortunately, in some African countries, the Egyptian vulture is highly sought after so that its body parts can be used for not only traditional medicine, but to ward off evil.Today the bird of the pharaohs, once revered on three continents, faces extinction. Soon the only memory of its impressive silhouette would be a shadow of the past.This film will highlight the Egyptian Vulture, its struggles, and its victories. Filming has already begun, and we need that little extra push to complete it.\n'

Please help us to pay for this equipment and save one of the few drive-in theaters left in America.\n'
Current:
u'\nHenagar Drive In Theater was built in 1999 by Lanita Price and family.\xa0 It has not only been family owned and operated but has truly became a part, of not just our family but our small community as well.\xa0 We ran with a 35 mm. projector for 14 years until the major movie companies stopped making films in 35 mm. The major studios only distribute motion pictures in digital projection now. Therefore we had to decide to go digital or close our doors. This was not a very simple decision because digital projection is so expensive, but also because of all the challenges this small drive in has already faced.\xa0 In 2009, on Christmas Eve, the screen was totally destroyed by a gravity wave that hit our area.\xa0 Then after rebuilding, on April 27,2011 an EF 5 tornado devastated our area and took our business with it. We were completely disheartened, but this business is in our blood and with the help of friends and our amazing community we rebuilt again! Now we are facing our biggest obstacle: paying for the digital projector. That is why we started our campaign, we ask you to help us keep and American Tradition alive.

u"\nOne of my favorite hardcore punk bands is playing a rare show https://www.facebook.com/events/806791829365103/ I've seen them four times, and they put on one of the best performances I've ever seen. The last time they were town, I missed them because the venue was at capacity. I need your help to fly to Arizona, see the show, and then make a comic book about the experience. \n"
Current:
u'\nI\'ve been reading comic books for 21 years, going to punk rock shows for 17 years, and after 15 years of being unable to start a band, I\'ve been drawing comics for about the past two years.I grew up reading Marvel comics, which I still love, but as I\'ve gotten older my tastes have drifted more towards artists like Daniel Clowes, Adrian Tomine, Evan Dorkin, and Los Bros Hernandez. I\'ve been taking evening classes at the Sequential Artists Workshop, a small non-profit school for alternative comics creators, that just happened to open up right in my backyard a couple months after I split up with my wife. Without SAW, there is a good chance I would have left Gainesville by now.My previous comic, "Give Thanks" is a small slice of life dealing with the aftermath of that divorce. I will be selling it, along with the SAW student anthology, at the Small Press Expo, in Bethesda Maryland, September 13 and 14.Even though comics are my primary focus right now, punk rock has been a huge influence on me, especially the way it breaks down the barrier between artist and audience. About 14 years ago a band I had seen several times first approached me about setting up a show for them in my sleepy little hometown, giving me a crash course in DIY. My current Kickstarter project involves that weird intersection artist/audience and punk/comics. The band Hour Of The Wolf is not incredibly well known, but they have one of the most amazing live shows I\'ve ever seen, and I have gotten to be friends with them. Their singer is also a terrific painter and illustrator, and he has been a great source of encouragement for my art.They are having a reunion show in Arizona on September 26, and my goal is to be able to take off a couple of days from my day job (working for poverty wages in a public school with at-risk 6th graders), fly out to AZ, and make a comic book about both the trip and my relationship to punk rock in general, and Hour Of The Wolf in particular. My goal is very low, since I have access to cheap printing through SAW, and I\'m pretty well stocked on art supplies due to a recent liquidation sale at the local art supply store.Rewards include not only copies of my comics, but accommodations for The Fest, a massive punk rock event with over 300 bands in Gainesville, FL, Halloween weekend, as well as original art commissions. I will draw anything backers want, within the limits of my ability, India Ink on archival quality 9x12 bristol board. For comparison, check out the "Drawings You Want" series by Josh Bayer, another source of support and inspiration for me.Links - https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1173689085/hour-of-the-wolf-reunion-show-comichttp://philipaweiss.tumblr.com/http://instagram.com/genghiskohenhttps://www.facebook.com/events/806791829365103www.thefestfl.comhttp://joshbayer.tumblr.com/post/90232173961/upcoming-pages-for-thing \n'

The festival has outgrown us and we need your help.This year, as we did last year with our successful campaign, we aspire to offer real assistance to our visiting artists. Funds raised will go toward travel costs, hospitality, and housing. In addition to chartering a bus to bring visiting participants -- all 80 of them -- from from Providence, RI to NYC, we're daydreaming of giving them all per diems for food and local travel. This is in addition to the performance honorariums we\u2019re committed to offering all bands, which will inevitably be used to cover their travel costs to get to and from their hometowns.We know from experience that a happy, well-rested artist produces a superlative performance experience for all! Especially for those artists new to the city who don\u2019t know the MTA as well as they know their instruments. (And by the way, we are looking for volunteers to help with handling the artists, getting them to and from their temporary NYC homes to gigs, assisting them with subway navigation, etc. We\u2019re also looking for food donations for our participants and volunteers-only potluck on the night of October 14.)Our talented musicians and dancers are dedicated to bringing you the best show EVER!Another, and perhaps the most vital, element of HONK NYC! is you, our audience. The energy of our festivalgoers makes all the magic possible. In order to bring New Yorkers another spectacular year of HONK NYC!, our Kickstarter earnings will also cover production costs like\xa0promotion,\xa0permitting, and\xa0equipment rental.\xa0We want to ensure our artists sound and look great in front of substantial crowds at all of our shows.Lastly, HONK NYC! is committed to compensating participating\xa0local acts with a small stipend during the festival, as local musicians incur travel and production expenses of their own. In past years,\xa0our NYC-based HONK NYC! bands -- large ensembles themselves -- have often generously donated their own door-take to the visiting artists, in order to help their colleagues out with the hefty costs of playing in NYC.We think ALL of our festival participants should make more than $12 a gig (what we paid out per person in 2009).AND, we believe our audiences shouldn't have to fork over a full day's wage to attend a concert.With shows every single day from Monday, October 13 through Saturday, October 18, you will have nonstop opportunities to see and hear all of our artists! Find our schedule here and on our Facebook page.A bigger, better festival is within our reach!\n\nPerhaps Contraption at P.S. 10 for HONK NYC! 2013\n\nWe LOVE our School Program!\xa0\nWhat child doesn\u2019t love a moment to dance, sing, play music and express themselves? HONK NYC! believes all children should have the opportunity to enjoy the wonder and magic of live music.

u"\nThe iHelmet is a stylish sports \xa0helmet for all extreme sports incorporating a stills and video camera, GPS, Smartphone connectivity, bluetooth live streaming via your smartphone,track/find friends,RACE, MP3 player (licensed), EU tested and certified.\n\ni helmet\n\n\xa0 The multimedia iHelmet is a stylish sports helmet for all extreme sports incorporating a front and rear facing \xa0video cameras, still cameras,.\nAs the headline claims we have developed \xa0our \xa0iHelmet \xa0to incorporate two cameras capable of taking stills and video, a MP3 player ( under license) with built in headphones, GPS, live streaming, Race function, find friends, and \xa0all controlled by a remote control worn on your wrist..\xa0\nThe hardware is incorporated into a number of different versions of the iHelmet, so no matter which is your sport of choice there will be a multimedia iHelmet for you. Whether you ride horses, skateboards or mountain bikes, you could be a skier or snow boarder, there will be a iHelmet for you. There are even waterproof versions under development , so if you are a diver, kayaker, white water rafter there will be an iHelmet for you.\xa0\nWhat does it mean, well you could be listening to your favourite tunes, downloaded into the internal memory of the iHelmet, when you decide you are going to take a photo of your buddy or a video, as he sets of down the hill. you press a button, you start recording, and hey presto, you have your video of your buddy coming a cropper,. The video can be lived streamed via your smart phone directly to your Facebook account, You Tube, Vimeo or our dedicated web site. Or, it is saved on the built in memory ready for you to upload to youtube, vimeo, Facebook \xa0as soon as you get home to your computer.\xa0\n\nwrist remote\n\nSo who are we, and where we are with our project? : We are a couple of aging extreme sports junkies, who have taken years to realise that what the world needs is our input.\xa0Whilst having a time out in a\xa0restaurant on the ski slopes recently, we watched a compilation of home videos from the likes of youtube, involving other peoples misfortunes, which are\xa0guaranteed\xa0to make you laugh, cringe or oooh with sympathy. We originally developed and produced \xa0 what we thought and \xa0were hoping to be a world first, sunglasses incorporating an MP3 player , camera and video camera, only to find that its not such a unique product after all and \xa0there are other models on the market,( but hopefully none with the quality as ours?).Whilst skiing recently , and after hearing the very sad news of Michael Schmacher's skiing accident \xa0, we realised that whilst we have a brilliant product ,we could use what we had already developed , enhance further and at the same time increase the safety of skiers on the slopes.. After seeing hundreds of skiers and snowboarders looking like telly tubbies \xa0with various models of cameras strapped to their helmets, and us wearing our helmets with our glasses on, why not incorporate the workings of the glasses into a helmet. Research has also shown that helmet use is increasing by 30% annually and after Michaels accident , ski helmet sales shot up 300%.But the frightening thing is, mounting cameras onto a helmet weekens the shell of the helmets and they are no longer guaranteed or certified. In \xa0fact the wearers are more prone to serious injury if using a mountable camera strapped to the helmet. We have spent the last six months developing the hardware, designing the helmet, creating the mould , made and tested the first prototypes.Further development under progress has proved that we will be able to use our current technology and hardware for use in any type of helmet for any type of sport.Working with our hardware suppliers and have developed the first prototype, and are currently incorporating the hardware into a number of further prototype helmets for various sports. \xa0The prototype \xa0iHelmet has the following specifications:\xa0\n\xa0- Functions :\n\xa0Video recorder +digital camera + PCcamera + Media player +flash memory storage\n-\n\xa0Video resolution : 800 X 600 @25fps; format AVI\n-\n\xa0Video storage : 11min/GB\n-\xa0\nAvailable camera resolution: 3.2Mega Pixels (2048 X 1536);\xa0format JPEG\xa0\nPhoto storage around 1000 pictures/GB\n-\xa0\nCamera range: 0.3 meters to infinity\n-\xa0\nBuilt in microphone\n-\xa0\nRemote control photo shooting and music player\n-\xa0\nCamera RF remote control frequency: 433MHz\n-\xa0\nRTC (real time clock) to track capture time of videos and photos\n-\nTrip Viewer-review your performance stats, max speed-\nJump Analytics, measure and track the number of jumps.\nNavigation,pinpoint your location on a resort map.\nBuddy Tracking,locate and track kids, friends via a app on their smartphone.\nSmartphone connectivity, live video streaming.\nBluetooth connectivity, answer calls.\n\xa0Rechargeable Battery: macro molecule polymer li-ion\xa0rechargeable\xa0battery\n-\xa0\nRecharge time 2 hours\n-\xa0\nBattery life:\xa0up-to\xa060 minutes for video recording (maximum\xa0continuous\xa0recording time), around 3 hours for camera shooting, and around 2 hours for music playing\n-\xa0\nBuilt in Micro SD card (non\xa0replaceable) \xa0\n-\xa0\nUSB 2.0 interface\xa0\n-\xa0\nStandard mini USB port for upload, download and recharge\n-\xa0\nDurable hi quality and low weight\n-\n\xa0built in stereo headphones\xa0\nAll the video footage in our project video was filmed on the iHelmet prototype, by an 11 year old boy. That's how easy it is to use. What the video doesn't show is original sound track of him cursing and swearing, we \xa0had to edit \xa0that out.\n\nwristband remote\n\n"

u'\nNothing is worse than coming back from a day of hunting, fishing, boating or hiking and seeing your support system looking like this.\n\nThis is a picture of my neighbors slinky system. They use their trailer every other weekend so while they were gone look what happened. This slinky just doesn\'t work and what an eye sore. I would hate to think about the odor/ smell inside.\n\n\nHow about a sexy looking sling with a camo design :) This can\'t kink by design and looks great as well.\n\n\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0" THE SLING"\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Sexy looking and practical and it works every time!!!!YOUR GOING TO NEED IT FOR YOUR CAMPER, TRAILER OR RVHey Kickstarter fans, How do I make my project memorable? It\'s hard when your talking about a Sewer Hose Support System. To be honest my system might not be real sexy but it works and is clearly a better way to support your gray and black water hose coming from your camper, travel trailer or RV. KINKING AND CREEPING\xa0are two words well known to most campers when it comes to their sewer hose support system. The SLINKY is the system everyone uses because there was NO other real alternative system until "THE SLING." You just set it and forget it. With the slinky your hose can fall over or kink up and your waste water hose is no longer\xa0in a gravity position. Your hose being in a gravity position is very important because this is how and why your waste reaches the sewer hole and is disposed of into the sewer system. Who wants waste or sewer smell to back up into your living space because your hose is kinking, and those of you who have campers, trailers or RV\'s know this is a very common reoccurring problem. I have already received a patent pending and now I want to begin manufacturing this unique product. I have made a "camo" design prototype for the first production model that helps your hose to better blend into your surroundings and be more pleasing to the eye. My device actually supports, suspends and protects your hose from the weather and weed eaters as well. THE SLING also keeps your hose in a continual gravity position and up off the ground which is a EPA requirement in some states. I plan to have a PATRIOTIC SLING\xa0( red, white and blue in color) as well for those who like to show your patriotism for our great country. I have taken this project as far as I can with my limited finances. I would greatly appreciate your participation in manufacturing and bringing this important product to market. The first 1000 pieces will be 15 feet in length and will be packaged to sell on internet retail sites such as E bay and Amazon,The price point will be between $39.95 - $49.95.This pricing is very comparable to my competition. I know when intelligent, informed consumers compare my device to the Slinky solution, the "Sling" will be the obvious choice. A proforma of where the money will be spent is available to anyone interested.\xa0Thanks again for all your support and I am happy to answer any questions you may have concerning my product. Once funded, I plan to approach celebrities such as Willie Robertson on Duck Dynasty for product endorsement and product placement at Bass Pro Shops and Gander Mountain. You can be a part of this improved solution becoming a permanent part of our camping enjoyment. Future plans include College colored Slings and logo Slings giving name recognition for Travel Trailer and RV manufacturers.\n\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0SO EASY TO STORE!!!!!\n\n"THE SLING" folds up nicely compared to the slinky. Small and compact makes life easier for camping enthusiasts.\n\nFINALLY A SEWER HOSE SUPPORT SYSTEM THAT WORKS 24-7\xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0I\xa0GUARANTEE ITAs you can see from the superior design the hose is completely off the ground at all times. This ensures your sewer hose can\'t kink or creep causing smell or fluid backup.\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 WHAT YOU GET WITH MY "SLING" PACKAGE1. One 15\' sling made of moisture proof material that will not mold or mildew. This piece is 10 inches wide with 30 rust proof grommets (15 on each side).2. 35 feet of nylon parachute cord that holds the sling in place.3. One 18" Gear Tie that is sewn in at the end that connects to the Trailer or RV discharge sewer connection.4. The choice of "camo" or Patriotic (red - white - blue).\n\nMost campgrounds and RV parks take the disposal of waste seriously so be prepared to have your sewer hose completely up off the ground at all time with "THE SLING"\n\n\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 MY FLYER SAYS IT ALL\n\n\n'

Kyoto Soy Foam has been newly introduced to the seasoning market in Japan. Would be very much appreciated if you support, share, and connect with our innovative new seasoning from Kyoto, Japan. #KyotoSoyFoam !\n\xa0 \nWhat is Kyoto Soy Foam?\xa0\n\xa0-Story:\xa0Nearly 10 years ago, my friend brought me\nto some restaurant, and I happened to have an experience of "soy foam"\nfor the first time.\xa0I heard about a myth of soy foam, it was\nmade in consideration of the cook, when the person wearing a kimono or a MAIKO herself has a meal, so as not to make stain on the kimono with splashing soy\nsauce" , I was very much impressed at such Japanese "hospitality".\n\n\n\xa0-Texture: After mixing with water, the texture of\xa0Kyoto Soy Foam becomes very fluffy with lots of bubbles.

Would be very much appreciated if you support, share, and connect with our innovative new seasoning from Kyoto, Japan. #KyotoSoyFoam !\n\xa0 \nWhat is Kyoto Soy Foam?\xa0\n\xa0-Story:\xa0Nearly 10 years ago, my friend brought me\nto some restaurant, and I happened to have an experience of "soy foam"\nfor the first time.\xa0I heard about a myth of soy foam, it was\nmade in consideration of the cook, when the person wearing a kimono or a MAIKO herself has a meal, so as not to make stain on the kimono with splashing soy\nsauce" , I was very much impressed at such Japanese "hospitality".\n\n\n\xa0-Texture: After mixing with water, the texture of\xa0Kyoto Soy Foam becomes very fluffy with lots of bubbles. These bubbles stay as they are over night.\n\n\n\xa0-Low Sodium:\xa0Sodium concentration of Kyoto Soy Foam is only 5%, nevertheless it contains from 15% to 18% in the normal soy sauce, this number is just about one-third from normal products. It could be very low salt considerable, because even in comparison with most of low sodium soy sauce which contains from 7% to 8%.\xa0\n\n\nHow will you use #KyotoSoyFoam?\nPour water three times to the amount of Kyoto Soy Foam\xa0powder in a closed container.\xa0Shake it well.\xa0And let it sit in the fridge for 30mins.\xa0Foam stays for one day.

u"\nThe project and the about me really go hand in hand since I am the project. With the game of golf I have had more downs than ups with this game yet still cling to the possibility that I could play this game at the highest level. Right now with the cost of a good set of clubs being so high and working nights on an hourly wage it really doesn't cover the cost of being able to purchase them. This would be the first step on my road to becoming a Tour Professional. With the new set of clubs I would be able to start getting my golf game in order again. The reason I do not have clubs at the moment was that I was working at a golf course but with cost of living being so high all my money went to bills and food with one particularly bad month and unexpected bills I had to sell my golf clubs. My main goal is being able to acquire a sponsor to start playing the professional mini tours. These are also very expensive being you might need $40-50,0000 for year covering cost of living, play/practice time, traveling, coaching etc.... any money I receive over the cost of the equipment will go to pay for tournaments etc..\xa0 I am 33 years old, and have had a roller coaster of a time with golf in my life. I didn't get into the game till I was about 18. I got my handicap very low in my early 20s and did not play in college. I started playing the mini tours in Southern California when my then ex girlfriend decided to steal everything I own and leave me penniless. I decided to move out to AZ where my family was and start over, another time in my life where I had no golf clubs the game was forgotten for the next 7 years where I got into sales. What brought me back was when I went out and shot 71 first time on a golf course in almost a decade. I quit my sales job and got a job at a golf course. Playing and practicing I was able to get my game down to a +3 handicap and shooting mid 60s to low 70s consistently. The problem was that I had no money for tournaments and no contacts for a sponsor. Now here I am today, I gave up on golf over a year ago frustrated but it has never left my mind. I watch the television coverage every week dreaming I was there. This is pretty much one of my last shots at doing something. Thank you very much!\n"

We will then send you a survey asking how you wish to spend your total pledge amount.\nExtra episode (any of them) - $7\nExtra season pass - $20\nDigital Original Sound Track - $10\nT-Shirt - $30 for shipping in Canada \xa0+$10 for U.S. or $20 elsewhere\nBacker-exclusive custom snowmobile - $10\n\n\n\nOctober, 1970. Another long and cold winter is beginning in Northern Quebec. The local Cree community clash with rich industrialist W. Hamilton, copper mine magnate in the region. The Crees accuse the latter of destroying sacred lands for the sole purpose of increased profits. Suspiciously, Hamilton\u2019s summer residence and hunting manor\xa0is subject of vandalism and thefts. Convinced that the Cree are responsible, Hamilton calls Carl Faubert, a war veteran turned private detective, to handle the affair.Carl never refuses an easy case, especially when the client has such deep pockets. He jumps in his faithful pick-up truck and heads up north to meet with Hamilton.\xa0Unable to find his client at the meeting point, Carl starts to search for him. After knocking on some doors, the detective finds not only the rich man is missing... but the whole area is deserted.Where is the local population? What happened to Hamilton? Are the Cree involved? Welcome to K\xf4na, an episodic game about investigation, exploration, survival and the mysteries surrounding the disappearance of W. Hamilton and the neighboring inhabitants.\n\n\n\n\nK\xf4na combines the atmosphere and immersion of a modern survival title with the deep storytelling and puzzle-solving aspects of a traditional\xa0adventure game.ObjectiveThe main objective of the game is\xa0to\nsolve the mystery surrounding the disappearances. You can expect to do the following:\nExplore vast, open environments\nSolve various puzzles\nTry to locate people who could help solve the mystery\nSearch for clues (artifacts, notes) related to the investigation\n\nTake pictures of evidence\nSurvive\nAs you may have seen already, you actually get to drive Carl's Pickup Truck and, later on, a snowmobile. Unlike similar games in the genre, you have full control of the vehicles.\nChallengesK\xf4na is a game built for people with brains. There are no such things as waypoints or mandatory tutorials. You have to figure out how to progress in the game yourself, using the tools available to you.\xa0You also have to worry about your survival in those hostile northern lands. You\nmight need to use a weapon against unexpected threats.\xa0You could also get trapped\nin a bitter blizzard.\xa0If you are losing blood or freezing\xa0outside, your time is limited. You must heal your wounds or find warmth before it's too late.\xa0\n\n\n\n\nSimilar to games like Dear Esther and Stanley Parable, a narrator constantly adds depth to the game.\xa0The pieces of story that are revealed to you vary dynamically according to your in-game whereabouts and actions.\xa0Narrator PerspectiveK\xf4na's story is told through an omniscient third-person narrator. Imagine playing the main character of a captivating campfire tale. That\u2019s what this game is all about.\nThe StorytellerFor the French version of the game, the story is told by Fran\xe7ois Devost - an experienced storyteller who\xa0employs a style authentic for the character and time.\xa0For non French speakers, we\nbelieve that the game will be well worth playing at least once in its original\nlanguage - with English subtitles - to truly appreciate the unique, authentic\natmosphere of this rich historical mystery.Don\u2019t worry non French\nspeakers \u2013 the game\nwill also come with a professionally translated and recorded English voice\ntrack. In that regard,\xa0feel free to contact us if you are an English voice actor or if you would like to someone - it\xa0would be really helpful!The Story\nThe story is written by an talented writer, David B\xe9langer. David is a PhD student in literature at the Universit\xe9 du Qu\xe9bec \xe0 Montr\xe9al. He published his first book\xa0at the beginning of 2014 as well as several scientific publications over the course of his studies. His skills to play with words and to craft thrilling tales is crucial to K\xf4na's narrative.\xa0While we quickly translated some of his writings ourselves for the campaign, the final script will be translated by professionals. You can expect the final English version of the story to be equally as good as the French one!\n\n\n\n\nThe Format\nAs mentioned earlier, the game will be divided into four episodes. All these should take approximately the same time to complete as other popular episodic games (The Walking Dead, Kentucky Route Zero), which means between one or two hours on average, depending on the amount of time you take to explore the awe-inspiring environments.The GraphicsTo realise the K\xf4na world, we use several techniques such as image cross-processing, desaturation, high contrast, on-screen noise, strong bloom and vignetting\xa0to\ngive the game its 40-years-old-vintage look.\xa0VRSupporting virtual reality for the game is at the top of our wish list. K\xf4na would be awesome on the Oculus Rift. That unfortunately comes at a cost we cannot impose on all backers. Instead of being part of the base goal, the VR support will appear as the first stretch goal of this campaign.The MusicWe've reached out to and convinced Cur\xe9 Label, a folk-rock band from Quebec, to help us give the game a soundtrack that fits the period.\xa0Wondering\xa0how that sounds? Turn up the volume and play these samples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCombined with the savings we have in the company bank account, the $40,000 base goal is enough money for us to finalize our current design of the first episode.\xa0Needless to say, the more we get, the higher the quality of the game will be.Stretch GoalsWe plan to add stretch goals later, but we want to focus on getting to the base goal for now. When the campaign will get close to it, we'll work with the community to add meaningful stretch goals for our backers. VR and consoles being at the top of our current wish list :)Budget Breakdown\n$26,000 is the bare minimum that the three developers, the musicians, the narrator and the writer agreed to receive in order to create the first episode.\xa0We\u2019re doing it for the\nlove, not the money!\n~$10,000 for outsourcing (the English translation,\xa0some necessary sound design and animations)\n~$4,000 in administrative fees (Kickstarter and the bank)\nEven though our share of the money will barely pay for food and rent,\xa0we are passionate and committed\nto working for these minimum wages in order to realise our dream of seeing the\nproject successfully funded and completed.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlexandre Fiset (Producer, LinkedIn) has more than six years of experience in interactive media development, including four at Beenox, an Activision-owned studio. He also presided his local IGDA chapter for three years and gave many speeches in Quebec-based schools. With more than six credited retail 3D games, two as an Associate Producer, Alex has the expertise to drive the team to success. He also helps with the code, user interface and level design for the game.Etienne Lemieux (Artist)\xa0has more than three years of experience in interactive media development, including two years at\xa0Beenox. He creates shaders\xa0and 3D art assets for the game.Maxime Charbonneau\xa0(Programmer) finished his robotics engineering degree in 2012 and joined the two others to found Parabole.\xa0His\nprogramming skills and his knowledge in vehicle physics are essential to the game's development.\xa0UsSince we started the company, we've successfully convinced many businesses that we have the talent and expertise to create top quality interactive content.Now, we don't want our next client to just be some business. We want our next client to be you. We want to use our expertise to create unique games for everyone. The problem is, even with some contracts coming in, we don\u2019t have enough money to bring the project to quality and scale it deserves. The bottom line is, if you like what you see on this page and want to see this project in your game library, you can make it happen either by pre-ordering the game here or by sharing our project with gamers around you. In return, we promise to deliver one of the most unique first-person adventure games you\u2019ve ever played!\n"

u'\n***UPDATE***\nAs of 6 pm West Coast time on Monday, August 11th, we have reached my stretch funding goal of $7,000!I am totally floored. We reached the stretch goal in two days. This means that I am able to fully fund my dream album. I can afford the very best mixing and mastering and fully compensate all the other musicians and artists who are supporting me along the way.I need to figure out how to respond to this unexpected generosity! I will post another update soon.***UPDATE***As of 9:30 am West Coast time on Saturday, August 9th, we have reached the funding goal of $5,400!This is cause for celebration! The album will exist! I get to finish the project and send out all your rewards and throw a big CD release party. This is a wonderful feeling, to be supported by an extended community to live out my dreams. Thank you all so much.I have two new project goals, which will help me hugely as a solo, independent working artist.Goal #1: To reach 300 total backers!Goal #2: To reach $7,000!For more information on these goals and the motivation behind setting them, check out the update I just posted by clicking on "Updates" at the top of this page, above the video.-------------------I am making an album! A real, actual, full-length studio album! That is, I am hoping to make an album, but I need your help.I have been playing music and singing my whole life long, but it took me a couple of decades and some hard times to come around to becoming and owning my identity as a musician, a songwriter, and a performer. This collection of songs is the result of the last few years of heartache, loss, career change, resilience, love, and musical growth. I am proud of these songs and of who I have become through the process of writing them and I can\'t wait to share them with you!The songs for this album were all born out of losing someone close to me. My dad taught me to love and play music and he left me here on this earth with a song to sing and a voice to sing it with. Writing these songs over the past year has brought me peace, joy, pain, sorrow, and a great deal of healing. Through songwriting, I can create and process a narrative of his disappearance that ends up being beautiful and universal, despite the bizarre details of his loss. I hope that this album can offer that same healing journey to others.Making an album is expensive, and for good reason. This kind of project involves a lot of time and collaboration among many talented people who deserve to be well-compensated for their skills and effort (not to mention some super fancy equipment!). I have a great crew of people helping me, including a skilled engineer, Dan Rhiger at Medicine Whistle Studios in SE Portland, a wise and compassionate producer, Matt Meighan, and a whole bunch of extremely talented and generous musician friends who are adding harmonies and instrumentation to make these songs come alive. The cost of the project will include studio time, mixing, mastering, manufacturing, and compensation for the producer, studio musicians, artists, and friends who are helping along the way. If successfully funded, I hope to have the album finished and out by the end of November of this year.I am excited to turn to Kickstarter and crowd-funding to make this project happen. The thing I like about crowd-funding is that everyone who\n gives money is helping me front the cost of this project, much like a \nrecord label would have done in years past. If you give $10, you are essentially pre-ordering the album. By committing to buy it now, your purchase is actually helping to create the album. How cool!But here is the catch with Kickstarter - I need to hit that $5,400 goal to get any money at all for this project. I will have all my fingers and toes crossed for the next 30 days, hoping to reach that goal! Donate what you are able and share the project with others in your life you think might enjoy and be affected by this music. I am really excited about the rewards I will get to give out if this project is funded. First and foremost, AN ALBUM. Lots of CDs! CDs for everyone! Whoa. In addition, I am going to have some awesome art designed by a friend, Allison Staley, that will be screen-printed onto limited edition T-shirts. And recordings of your favorite cover songs! And fancy shmancy Executive Producer cred! And even a house concert anywhere in the continental United States! And everyone who gives any amount will be on the list for the CD release party in Portland (date and location TBD) so we can all party together and celebrate! All of you who don\'t live in Portland should come to Portland and join us. Winter in Portland is wonderful...if 45 degrees and rainy is your favorite kind of weather.Thank you so much for checking out my Kickstarter page. I hope you will be a part of this community of people helping me to get this music out into the world. It is a leap of faith to put this out there, but I believe in this album and I believe that we can make it happen. Let\'s do this!\n'

u'\nKingston Alexander is a new fashion forward jewelry and accessory line that I started in the comfort of my own home. It is a branch off of my mother\u2019s B\u2019Dangle & Co. Jewelry line that was left to me after my mother passed away in 2003. In 2009 I decided that I would pick up where she left off and make jewelry pieces just for fun, which turned into therapy for me. Ive since made it an income source and would like to expand far beyond the small circle that knows about what I do. I not only do this as an income but as a tribute to my mother. I am asking for your help to expand and reach a broader audience as I start my business and dive head first into the fashion industry. I not only have ideas as to what I would like to design but I have done my research and understand that with this comes an immense amount of responsibility and hard work because startups aren\u2019t as easy as they seem. With these funds I know that I can get my business off the ground and flourish as a designer. I greatly appreciate you taking the time out to help aid me in my journey as I take a leap into the world of Entrepreneurship. \n'

u"\nHello my name is Mischon Williams and I am the designer and owner of Kingston Alexander jewelry. Kingston Alexander is an extension of my mothers jewelry collection called B'Dangle & Co. Jewelry that she left to me in 2003 when she suddenly passed away. I started Kingston Alexander in May of this year as an accessory line for men and women. The accessory line is to include men's and women's handcrafted jewelry and bags. Each piece is specially designed by me and is an original limited edition. I have started this kickstarter campaign to help fund Kingston Alexander so that I can produce the finished project needed in order for me to get my business up and running. I have designs mapped out that need to be produced for sale but without the funding I am unable to do so. Becoming a backer for my project will help get me closer to my finished product and launch me into production to expand my business and reach a broader audience. Thank you.\n"

u"\n My work observes the disparity between bodies that are socially regarded as unattractive, but are also artistically appealing in terms of their formal qualities.  I fell into this obsession when I was exposed to my first nude models during freshman year.  It was obvious to me that the bodies which had larger swelled areas that collapsed into folds were much more entertaining to render than the bodies that were thin and angular.\xa0\xa0Shortly after I began drawing these bodies, I began working with ceramics.  The physical density of the medium naturally conveys a visual weight.  I utilized this property in volumes, not exposing the actual thickness of the work.  I contrasted these ballooning volumes with grooves that quilt the body.  This creates an experience of tension through the lines and release through the expanse.   Ceramics also has a certain tendency to acquire dimples like a golf ball when it is being hand built quickly.  These qualities allowed the viewer to assume the likeness of human flesh and cellulite.  In addition to the undulating clay surface, I applied a glaze that created a pore-like texture that was tinted a color close to my own Caucasian skin tones.\xa0\xa0Engaging these qualities, I rely on the audience's ability to interpret the unspoken associations that are disclosed in my line, volume, and texture.\xa0I utilize geometry's artificiality to infuse my work with a rigidity that is man made. I concentrated on circles and ovals because of their natural tautness and even distribution of that stress.  I purposely punctuated the perimeter to direct where the sensation of tension is channeled. I begin my sculptures with this circular boundary to exemplify the preconditioned world we are born into.  To allow the audience freedom to investigate my work, I hung my work on the wall to distance the sculpture from direct reality.\xa0\xa0Akin to Richard DeVore's vessels, I employ ceramics' history of being associated between the body and the earth.  I engage the curves and crevasses that are found on the body.  These tend to have a natural resemblance to the earth\u2019s topography.  This physical relationship is the only realm that humanity exists on. It is tethered by our senses and maintained by an understanding of our impact.  The forms I create describe the oppressive relationship of humanity to the world and humanity to itself.  They  linger between being identified fully with either subject, yet the surface treatment sways the resemblance towards human.\xa0\xa0At the same time, my work hovers between being celebratory and off putting. My intentions were to celebrate and advertise the beauty of the fullness that flesh can acquire, yet the work raises questions of the health problems associated with obesity. It also approaches the idea of over consumption, humanity's greed, and disregard for the impact of that consumption. My work does not intend to lead to a solution, but simply exists as an observation of the current condition.\r\n"

u"\n\n\nHello world, this is Martavious Odoms and this is the second season of the #EATING project. \xa0We are planting more gardens and growing our program and we would like for you to join us.After playing college football I wanted to do something meaningful with my education. I have more opportunities than the average student and I wanted to do something big. I knew that we would have a lot of support from the Michigan community.\xa0\n\n\nWe started in 2012 and thanks to the support from mgoblog readers, reddit, alumni and fans we were able to make our first season a success. As we grow we hope to meet athletes from other schools who also are interested in joining our project.ABOUT US: The #EATING project is an urban agriculture project designed to bring food gardens to US neighborhoods. \xa0We are using technology tools (like Kickstarter) to network with other athletes, alumni, and fans to create community garden programs. \xa0Our focus is on rebuilding our neighborhoods and we have a great future ahead of us. \xa0We are working with Roger Horne, MPH MHA, (of\xa0Urban Greenworks) to plan and create our community gardens. \xa0Our first garden has been installed and is making a difference in our community already. \xa0We have senior groups as well as youth groups coming to help maintain it and people stop and take pictures. \xa0It is easier to feel better about your future when things around you look nice. This garden is just the first steps in #EATING.\n\n\nThis next season we are looking to grow products to sell at farmers markets and integrate an elementary school class curriculum. \xa0Also, we are expanding further into Michigan to add another #EATING garden. \xa0The #EATING project season 2 is $5. \xa0You will get pictures and videos and updates from us through out the year. \xa0 We are asking 8,000 people to back this season of #EATING. \xa0FUNDING GOALS:\n\n\nVISION: \xa0When we were thinking about projects that could really be positive for our communities we kept meeting people that were involved in community gardens. Gardens not only provide food, they build the local economy and create jobs and income. \xa0Community gardens have been very successful in Detroit and we want to support sustainable solutions and pass them on to the youth. \xa0We want to show people that positive moves progress. \xa0It is important to give people hope that things can change in time for the better.\xa0\n\n\nWe came up with the name of our project #EATING because Eating is slang for being successful and it is also our end-zone celebration. \xa0The # is because our project uses technology to connect with people. \xa0 The idea behind #EATING is to connect with as many people as we can to make positive changes in our communities. \xa0Because of football, I have been fortunate to have so many opportunities and connections to meet people to work with in order to make big changes. \xa0And that's why we chose Michigan, we did not just come to play football, we came for the education and the great supportive family that welcomed us.REWARDS:\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHATS UP WITH THE #EATING SHIRTS?\xa0\xa0When walking around Ann Arbor you always see people wearing a navy shirt with yellow writing. Maybe half the people you see on a given day. When we were looking to start our garden program we had two things in mind: How do we get fans to know about us and share what we are doing? How do we fund what we are doing? \xa0The solution: What if people could wear a shirt with the home team colors that directly benefited local communities? \xa0That way people that support blue and yellow can also support projects in our own communities. Additionally, our shirts are USA cotton and made in a vertically integrated factory and printed with eco-friendly ink. \xa0\xa0\n"

u"\nThis is a docudrama about a young man who suffers from schizophrenia. It details how it affects his life and what he deals with on a daily basis. This is based on actual events.So, what is a Schizophrenia?Schizophrenia  is a mental disorder often characterized by abnormal social behavior and failure to recognize what is real. Common symptoms include false beliefs, unclear or confused thinking, auditory hallucinations, reduced social engagement and emotional expression, and inactivity. Diagnosis is based on observed behavior and the person's reported experiences.How does it affect me?I spend a lot of time alone. Sometimes I hear people I know and work with in my head talking bad about me and poking fun at me, as if I was there monitoring the conversation. I sometimes manifest the idea that I am going to be fired as soon as I return to work. It's unpredictable and grabs my attention as if someone tapped me on the shoulder. I could be in the middle of an intense game of chess and all of a sudden my mind is overcome by the familiar voices of people I know. I have experienced visual hallucinations, it can be scary. From foot imprints making way across the carpeted living room floor to lifelike people who seem to appear then suddenly vanish, it is something I don't think I will ever be comfortable with.How do I treat my condition?If it wasn't for family I do not know what I would do. My family is very supportive and understanding of my condition. I am prescribed medication to help with my hallucinations and I am thankful for that. I see a doctor and since I do not have health insurance I have to get my medicine from the free health clinic.I try not to let my mind idle out, when my mind goes idle I start a downward spiral of uncontrollable thoughts. I do not know where they come from or what they mean. To stay occupied I enjoy playing acoustic guitar, watching movies, and repairing the occasional computer for friends and family.How long will this film be?It's going to be a one hour film.Why am i making this film? I want to promote mental health awareness and include information on how to cope with schizophrenia.\n"

u"\nOur GoalHere at Genuis Studios, we have loved multiplayer shooters for years, but feel that the genre is by now long past stale. With our game, we hope to bring innovation and freshness once again to the realm of online FPS. Our game involves very unique free for all gameplay that you won't have seen anywhere else, and it all takes place in over thirty very vast maps. Players will spawn at the beginning of a match and from then on, it will take the form of The Hunger Games. Players will have to scavenger the maps for food and resources with which they can make weapons to kill other players. This is an idea that's never really been tackled before, but it's something we would love to bring to life.Unfortunately, we're a small team who can't fund this ourselves, so we need your help. This is a dream for us, and with your help, we can make it come true.Where the Money's GoingThis is the first of several campaigns we will be holding for this project. The first $130 will be used to buy the software and basic tools to make the game, and all future campaigns will be additions we'd like to make to improve gameplay, make more maps, add more weapons etc. None of this is profit money.Rewards\nReward #1\xa0\nPledge\xa0$1\xa0or more\n\xa00 backers\nThanks.

This might be to unlock a door or obtain a new item. Puzzles will involve logic, search puzzles, and code breaking.\nTrading - You will be able to trade with other players that you chose to form alliances with.\nDynamic World - The maps will have many animals. Some docile, some aggressive.

u'\nWe here at The Spot - Coffee Room have the vision of a place of art, poetry, music, and of course, fine coffee beverages. We wish to convey the idea of relaxation combined with creativity through the presentation of the main space. A small stage will occupy one corner for the use of local poets and musicians, while rotating local art will pepper the walls. The weekends, however, will present a different place, as The Spot becomes the main refreshment bar for the adjacent concert hall. In both capacities, The Spot will provide a place for youth to feel safe and comfortable, but above all happy. Come Sip a Smile and enjoy your day more than you already were!\n'
Current:
u"\nThe Spot is not your average coffee house. These three things set us apart from the norm\u2014\xa01) the vision - The Spot will exist as part of a greater community of businesses housed in a single location. More specific, one building. The building is an old theater in downtown Erie PA with a central location to several colleges and high schools in the area, excellent for the mission at hand. This building is to be named Basement Transmissions and is a concert venue for local musicians and bands as well as smaller national acts that would otherwise have nowhere to play. This is the big concert experience for local artists, a place to spur dreams and encourage young musicians. This is a drug and alcohol free environment, so the young people coming to see them are not only off the street at night but in a safe environment, and they are already coming in droves!2) Our Part - As the coffee house, The Spot will offer a creative environment for people hard at work in the other capacities of Basement Transmissions. The other capacities include a recording studio, a silkscreen shop, a photography and dark room shop, a record store, and an art studio among other things. The Spot will be a gallery coffee room featuring art by local artist, student artists, and art produced by the people utilizing the aforementioned stores inside Basement Transmissions. The Spot will also be the main refreshment bar for the concert goers during show times, which means a guaranteed rotating customer base with repeat customers on weekends.3) the Menu - The Spot, with its young clientele and art community setting, needs to have an above average offering at competitive prices. The Spot is bringing the West Coast East with a menu that includes draft coffee, coffee shots, coffee bombs, draft root beer, draft cool-aid, and pizza cones and salads as well as familiar fare. Above that, The Spot will feature cupcakes and confectionaries by local pastry guru Kimberly Martin-Sprickman and her property, Make Way For Cupcakes, a partnership we are very excited about! Now don't let words like draft and shot mislead you, this is a drug and alcohol free environment so these drinks are sans alcohol, how awesome for these kids to get something on draft at a concert! \r\nIf these things resonate with you, partner with us as we strive to offer the best for the youth of today!Thanks,\xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Dana GenestAnytime is a good time to hit The Spot.\n"

u'\nThe process of bringing a tea towel to the market involves manufacturing costs, packaging costs and transportation charges. I\'m asking for your help to fund half the manufacturing costs.Hello,My name is Dinara Mirtalipova. I\'m an artist, a freelance designer and an illustrator.\nI started making tea towels because I wanted to brighten my boring kitchen. I was on a lookout for colorful happy tea towels that spoke my personality and couldn\'t find one. All those towels from Target and Walmart were boring and oldfashioned that screamed "use me to wipe off your dirty stove" and I wanted something that I could actually hang and wipe off my wet hands off, something that would brighten my kitchen and bring up my mood. Luckily there was Spoonflower so I just painted an image, scanned it and sent it off to Spoonflower to get printed on a cotton fabric. After it arrived I sewed it and shared it on my blog. To my surprise there were other people who found it charming.\n\nmirdinara kitchen towel\n\n\xa0Although the main purpose of a tea towel is to wipe off your hands, grad hot plates, pick up spills and dry glasses, it also carries an aesthetic purpose of making your place a bit brigher, thus you happier . What\'s unique about my towels is their origin, my imagination and nostalgia of a place I grew up in, it reflects the folklore, and ethnic songs.\xa0\n\nmirdinara kitchen towel\n\nI support a "business of giving" model mentality. Just like TOMS shoes. I believe in giving back and sharing. $1 from each towel will go towards Save the Children foundation.\n\nmirdinara kitchen towels\n\nThese towels are brights and colorful, it\'s an inexpensive way to change the look of your kitchen just by changing the hanging towel. The packaging will be just as festive, so it\'s a great way to give as a gift for a housewarming, a bridal shower, a birthday or a mother\'s day. It can be safely sent in mail without worrying about it being damaged. With every towel there will be included a story of a family that cooks together and share a recipe, so it will be a socially bonding towel that will bring people together through sharing their stories and recipes.\n\nMirdinara kitchen towel\n\nBy raising half the manufacturing costs I can afford to meet the minimum quantities requirements by the manufacturer and get this idea moving forward.Please show your support and love!xoxoDinara\n'

This revolutionary\ndevelopment is going to shift the way the world views dress shirts and what is\nacceptable.3. \xa0Setting\nthe new standard for dress shirts. \xa0Let\'s face it - no other garment in a man\'s closet is as versatile as the dress shirt.  You can dress it up or down, but in today\'s society, the open / unbuttoned look is the norm. We should expect our dress shirts to look their best at every moment.\xa04. \xa0Patented.5. \xa0Focused on getting the technology into your favorite brand. A successful campaign here on Kickstarter will provide us with the resources necessary to reach your favorite dress shirt manufacturers.

Working on an After-Market-Kit.\xa0This will allow you to purchase the stiffeners with directions for a tailor to install the technology into the favorite shirts already hanging in your closet.  But again, we need your initial backing on Kickstarter to make this a reality. Million Dollar Collar is NOT:\xa01. \xa0"Just a piece of plastic". \xa0Unlike a collar-stay, each\xa0stiffener must be specifically cut according to the specs and dimensions of each brand. \xa0One size stiffener would not fit all brands. \xa0This is our reason for bringing you a limited edition run of dress shirts manufactured by Million Dollar Collar.\xa0This Kickstarter is:\xa01.\xa0 YOUR opportunity to\xa0be on the forefront of a style revolution. By pledging towards a successful campaign, you\'re providing us with the resources necessary to to bring Million Dollar Collar to the masses. \xa02. YOUR opportunity to\xa0be the first with dress shirts installed with Million Dollar Collar. \xa0This is a\xa0limited edition run of incredible dress shirts - with Million Dollar Collar technology pre-installed. \xa0It\'s your chance to be one of the first behind the revolution that will change the way we manufacture dress shirts forever. \xa0End your "sloppy placket" frustration today.\xa0\xa03. \xa0An\nend to sloppy placket (aka #Placketitis). We should expect more from dress shirt\nmanufacturers and the look of our dress shirts. An unsupported placket leaves its wearer looking sloppy. It ends here.4. Worldwide:\xa0We\'ve already received pledges from backers in 8 countries on 4 continents (and growing).\n\n\n4. Getting a lot of attention:\xa0We are receiving inquiries worldwide and have already been published by the following publications:\n\n\n\n\xa0\nThe Limited Edition Dress Shirts\xa0(w/ Million Dollar Collar Technology)\xa0\n1. \xa0All\nmanufactured with Million Dollar Collar Technology.

The clothes you wear speak for you. They tell a story about you, even before you can say a word. What message is your wardrobe sending?Think about the arsenal of dress shirts in your closet... THEY HAVE FAILED YOU FOR YEARS!\nDress shirts were designed to make a statement, but more often than not they leave you looking sloppy when worn casually (slightly unbuttoned). HERE\'S WHY: All previous attempts to improve the look of a dress shirt have focused on starching and pressing and highlighting the collar\xa0such as adding any of the various collar stays on the market.\xa0\n\n\nHowever, the true Problem lies just below the collar in the upper PLACKET of the shirt. Due to the lack of reinforcement, the typical placket will sink, wrinkle and fold leaving you looking sloppy when unbuttoned.\nThe fact is, nothing has been done to address this glaring problem, which is hard to believe, because the PLACKET is the true focal point of a dress shirt.\n\n\nThe Solution\nThe Solution? Million Dollar Collar - The First and ONLY, permanently installed placket stiffener available. It has been specifically designed to enhance the look of a dress shirt and more importantly it\'s wearer, YOU.Million Dollar Collar\'s patented "stay-up" design has been developed and tested to lay flat at the bottom of each stiffener, then gradually roll out at the top towards the collar. \xa0Each stiffener goes beyond the placket into the collar band so there is no 90 degree fold at the top of the shirt, while precise stitching holds the stiffener in place. We\'ve obsessively researched and specifically engineered the stiffeners so they could be permanently installed for cost effective care\xa0of at home washing, drying & ironing, and the\xa0convenience\xa0of laundering the shirt at the dry-cleaners.\xa0\n\n\nHere it is: The most significant advancement in dress shirts since the collar stay was patented in 1953. This revolutionary development is going to shift the way the world views dress shirts and what is acceptable. This is your chance to be one of the first people on Earth to be cured of "Sloppy Placket."We call it Million Dollar Collar, because you\'ll feel like a Million bucks every time you wear a shirt with it installed.\n\n\nThe IdeaBelow is a photo of me - Rob - on my wedding day. Even after obsessively starching and ironing my new\xa0shirt to ensure a crisp look, this was the final result. From the moment I saw this photo, I was determined to develop a solution, so we look our best not only on the most important days of our lives, but all the days in-between.\n\nRob Kessler - Wedding Photo\n\nShirt FeaturesWe\'ve made sure that the shirts made with Million Dollar Collar are second-to-none.  We are using the finest long strand cotton (AKA Egyptian or Giza), and we\'ve designed a stylish curved cuff that can be buttoned or dressed up with cuff links. The new standard in dress shirt is available in a modern slim fit and a classic cut.\nOur fabric and high quality manufacturing are set, and the stiffeners are ready to be cut and installed, but we need your support to bring this revolution in dress shirts to life.  We are starting with a few essential colors and will add more as we hit higher funding goals, so check back often.\n\n\nJoin Us\nWe should expect more from dress shirt manufacturers and the look of our dress shirts. An unsupported placket leaves its wearer looking sloppy. But, it ends here. Join us in bringing this revolutionary advancement to life.\nPlease SHARE this Kickstarter with your friends, because we know they are just as frustrated with their Sloppy Plackets as we are.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet the Million Dollar Collar Team. With the love and support of my wife Linda, and the all-around creativity of my partner Steve we present to you Million Dollar Collar, the biggest advancement in dress shirts since the collar stay was patented 1953.

u"\nI wrote this book a few years ago for my son, Jaxon, who is 5 now\xa0He was always intrigued with his parent's tattoos and how he did not have any. It took the art of Scott Weisbecker to bring this story to life, and I think he hit it out of the park. I hope you will enjoy the book as much as we did creating it.\n"

u'\nMy son, Jaxon, who is 5 now, was always intrigued with my wife\u2019s and my tattoos.  He was always asking why we had them and why he didn\u2019t have any and when could he get one, you know how it goes.  When he was very young I had to explain what a tattoo was many times and thought that if there was a book I could read to him that was full of great art it would be a great help with my explanations.  I looked around and didn\u2019t see anything that fit the bill so I decided I\u2019d have a go at creating something.  My friend, Scott Weisbecker, who is also a tattoo artist, was the perfect choice for an illustrator.  His art has brought the book to life, and really makes it something special.  This will be a 48-page, full color 8.5 X 11 inch hard bound book.  All of the illustrations are hand drawn original artwork and are beautifully colored.  This book is truly something that even the most grizzled, tattooed old biker would be proud to keep on his coffee table for his grandkids to read.  I\u2019m trying to raise the capitol to publish the book here on Kickstarter.  Be sure to check the updates section for a couple more sample pictures and other information as it becomes available. \nI hope you will enjoy the book as much as we did creating it!\xa0\n'

u"\n\xa0Right now Mattfest is but an idea, but from that idea we hope to grow it into a full-fledged music festival in an area that's long starved for fun and entertainment. In addition to bringing in some of the region's best musical talents, I also plan to bring in artists to show off and sell their creations, area and regional food vendors to give attendees a taste of something a little different than their local fare normally has to offer, and of course some fun things outside and around the venue for the young kids to get into aside from jamming to their favorite tunes all day and into the night. The main point of Mattfest - besides bringing entertainment and an all-ages event to a long-starved area - is to provide bands and artists a chance to get to an area of the country and in front of people that they otherwise would not be able to, since there are no dedicated music venues not only in Hamburg, Arkansas, but anywhere in the surrounding areas and towns. I see Mattfest as something that could become an annual event and grow into something that artists, musicians, local chefs, and the local townspeople will look forward to and make a success year after year. That cannot happen without proper funding for advertising, marketing, and promotion.\xa0\n"
Current:
u"\n\xa0 \xa0The idea for Mattfest is simple: To celebrate the life of a young man and father who's been given a new lease on life. Matt Gulledge has battled with a lung condition known as Primary Cillary Dyskenesia along with bronchiectasis for thirty-two years. It is a rare disease that mimics cystic fibrosis. Matt was forced to resign from his teaching job in Lake Village, AR due to declining health and was put on an expedited list for a lung transplant. Matt received his double lung transplant over the summer and is now recovering. The family has been doing various fund raisers to cover expenses but there is still much left to do, so we're banding together through music to not only celebrate Matt's new lease on life, but to help with their fundraising efforts, as 100% of all ticket sales will go to Matt and his family. Mattfest is scheduled for Saturday, December 13th in Hamburg, Arkansas and will be an all-day and into the night affair, but even if you can't be in South Arkansas you can still contribute to this event and this cause GREATLY by making a pledge right here, even if it's only $1, every little bit will add up. We are bringing in some of the regions best band's in every genre, whether you're a fan of rock, country, rap, metal, pop, electronica, it doesn't matter there's something there for you...along with food vendors, artists selling their works, and plenty of things for the kids to do at this all ages event. However NONE of this can happen without your help!! We need to raise fund to cover costs for staging, sound, and lights, and that's where we need YOU! Even if you cannot contribute financially, you can do us a huge service by sharing this on your social media pages and spreading the word...let's make this happen folks!! Let's celebrate a young man's life through the power of music!!\n"

u'\nHOW IT WORKSThere are lots of cool designs on Kickstarter, but Massuni lets YOU be the designer. Here\'s how it\'s going to work, once we\'re fully operational:Step 1 - Browse the catalogue at massuni.com\xa0to find an item that\'s close to what you want. We\'re starting with about a hundred different designs, but our goal is to eventualy have every piece of furniture in the known universe. No - really!Step 2 - Once you\'ve found a piece you like, go to the Configurator and change it up. Tweak the dimensions, play with the style, try on a different finish or turn it into something entirely different. See prices and renderings along the way.Step 3 - Order it, and we\'ll build it. It\'s that simple!Want to know more? Watch these little demo videos:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\xa0Massuni\'s furniture is made in our own factory, using proprietary systems. All items are fully assembled for quality and durability. We use a combination of solid hardwoods and veneers to optimize resource consumption. Drawers are made with Baltic Plywood and European ball bearing full extension slides. Finishes are high quality catalyzed lacquers.Why support us on Kickstarter?Because Kickstarter backers will get access to the system before anyone else! The earlier you back the project, the earlier you will get access - and your furniture. We will not fill orders from other customers until all backers have their furniture.Also, the prices on all items in the initial catalog will be guaranteed for Kickstarter backers. Our pricing algorithm constantly adjusts for changes in material and labor costs, so after the initial launch, prices will fluctuate.And because we would really appreciate your support and encouragement! This project has been an enormous undertaking and we\'ll take all the encouragement - and cash - we can get, to finish development and get into production.\nChoosing RewardsSupporters can get individually customized furniture, so it\'s a little more complicated than usual to figure out what reward level to choose. Here are some suggestions:Option A - Browse through the Rewards described below. IF you like any of the items shown for a Reward Tier, simply pledge that amount. (And add shipping fees if necessary.)Option B - If you don\'t see any Rewards you like, go to massuni.com\xa0and view our entire introductory catalogue. Look through the catalogue, and if you see something you like, come back to Kickstarter and pledge that amount.Option C - If you REALLY don\'t know what you want, or are uncomfortable estimating, there are two easy choices: Go for the Design Consultation Reward Tier of $25, and we\'ll help you figure it out after the campaign. Or, select the $180 Reward Tier, which is pretty much the lowest price of any furniture we make, then pay the balance once you\'ve created your custom furniture.IMPORTANT: After the Kickstarter campaign has ended and we\'ve finished our development, Backers will be given first access to the website. You can then go and design your exact item, and confirm your order. If the final charge is higher than you pledged, we will bill you for the difference. If the final charge is less than you pledged, you will retain a credit that you can use in the future, or transfer to a friend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\nSHIPPINGMassuni provides FREE shipping with Canadian provinces and continental U.S. on items that fit within all of these limits:50" x 30" x 30" x 55lbs.

u'\n\n\nI once believed that I had it all. I was married to my childhood sweetheart and we had three beautiful, clever, funny daughters. I had a great job, nice car, nice home and a terrific social life. But I lost it all to depression.On my way home from work one day I was in a car accident and sustained a head injury. From that point on everything changed and depression took over my life. Depression slowly seeped into every crevice of my life. I was no longer able to do my job and was forced to resign. I began self medicating with alcohol and prescription drugs and overdosed three times. My marriage fell apart and my wife kicked me out when she could take no more.  Worst of all, my beautiful, innocent kids have been in the middle of it all.After a while I began writing about situations from my past that had made me laugh. I wanted to write them down so I wouldn\'t forget the good times. Funny situations, mishaps, life observations and events that made me cry with laughter once before began putting a smile on my face once again. Writing about the good times really helped get me the through dark times.I\'m compiling my stories and observations into a book called "Ya Gotta Laugh". A real book with pages made of paper. It\'s no Hemingway classic, but it should put a smile on your face. Some of the stories are a little naughty so be prepared. Depression is behind me now but I have nothing left. No car,\xa0no home, my marriage is over and on top of all of that, my relationship with my daughters is in tatters. I have a lot of damage to repair.\n\n\n'

It\'s no Hemingway classic, but it should put a smile on your face. Some of the stories are a little naughty so be prepared. Here is a story from the book:Rumpy Pumpy Orchestra(by David Rich)There is nothing more frustrating that inconsiderate, noisy neighbours; especially when you live in an apartment.I lived in an apartment for a couple of years. It was a nice place with a big balcony and great views. In the apartment downstairs there were three ladies in their twenties. I didn\u2019t know the ladies personally, but I know that they liked bringing guys home for a good time. I knew this because I could hear them bonking away night after night, as loud as an orchestra.The noise was relentless. Continuous knocking, banging, moaning, grunting, squeaking, and squealing, at all hours. At first I found it entertaining, but after a while it became annoying. Especially when I had to get up early after being kept up all night by the sex festival downstairs. I had to put a stop to it.It was a delicate situation. I couldn\u2019t let them know I was the one complaining; I didn\u2019t want things to be awkward every time I passed them in the hall. I had to make it look like the complaint was coming from someone else.I hatched a cunning plan to write a letter of complaint and make it look as though the letter was from the house across the street, where a family with a couple of young kids lived.I found myself some writing paper and wrote the letter. "Please keep the noise down at night. We can hear you from across the street and you are keeping us up. I don\u2019t want to have to call the police."I took the letter downstairs to the foyer, checked that the coast was clear and quickly slipped the note into the ladies mailbox while pretending to check my mail. Mission completed, or so I thought.The next afternoon I stood on my balcony facing the street, confident that I had put an end to the rumpy pumpy orchestra downstairs. I was quite pleased with myself and looking forward to a good nights rest. But my cunning plan backfired.The family across the street came outside to see off some guests. A moment later I heard the three lunatic women downstairs run out onto the balcony and they started making loud sex noises. Groaning, moaning, screaming, panting and saying "oh baby" as loud as they could.I quickly crouched down to hide. The family across the street looked on and were clearly shocked and confused about what was happening. They covered their children\u2019s ears and eyes and shuffled them inside. I couldn\u2019t see what the women downstairs were wearing or doing on the balcony, but if the people across the street were covering the kid\u2019s eyes, it couldn\u2019t have been good.The crazy ladies downstairs then started laughing triumphantly without shame. They had successfully served their revenge on the innocent family across the street. I waited until the coast was clear and then scampered inside.Unfortunately the rumpy pumpy orchestra continued, louder than ever. THE END\n\n\n\n\xa0\n'

u"\nThink you know about Nancy Drew?My name is Quincy MacShane and I am the creator of the Nancy Drew Board Game, a tabletop game that will educate girls around the world about a fantastic role model, Nancy Drew.Many famous women cite Nancy Drew as an influence toward shaping their success. Some of these include:\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Barbara Walters, Fran Lebowitz, Laura Bush, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Gayle King, Diane Sawyer, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Congresswoman Pat Schroeder among others. \xa0Through the creation of The Nancy Drew Game, I hope to encourage a new generation of girls to rediscover Nancy and learn about the series through a fun and interactive board game experience.The Nancy Drew Board Game is a trivia game designed for 2-4 players. Players dive into the Nancy Drew universe, learning about the adventures of Nancy Drew throughout the 56 book series.I've created a fun, educational game that serves as a continuation to the beloved Nancy Drew Book series.\n\n\nI've\xa0licensed\xa0the right to produce this game from\xa0Simon & Schuster and they have been very supportive of my efforts.\n\n\nPut your detective cap on, it's time to get sleuthing.Setting up the game:At the beginning of the game, the 56 bookcards are shuffled and 20 are placed into the 20 grey and black positions around the board. \xa0Because of this approach, each game starts off differently and no two games proceeds the same way.\nEach player chooses a character, Nancy Drew, George Fayne, Bess Marvin, Ned Nickerson, Dave Evans, Burt Eddleton, Carson Drew, or Hannah Gruen, and then picks a token to move around the board based on dice roll. \xa0Ideas for tokens include, a magnifying glass, flashlight, or perhaps Nancy\u2019s roadster.To determine who goes first, all players roll the dice and the player with the highest total starts the play the next players follow clockwise around the board. Each player places their token in the top right corner of the board, then throws the dice and moves their token clockwise the number of spaces indicated by the dice.\n\n\nGame Play:When a player lands on a book title, they will be asked, by the player to their right, a trivia question related to the book, from Nancy\u2019s Notebook. \xa0Nancy\u2019s notebook contains 4 questions for each of the 56 original Nancy Drew books. The first, a multiple choice question followed by 3 harder single answer questions. \xa0If the player answers the trivia question correctly, that player is given a bookmark (paperclip) to place over the corresponding trivia question number they just answered. \xa0The player who answers the question correctly and has a bookmark on the bookcard is considered to be \u201cbrowsing\u201d the book.\n\n\nUnlike Monopoly, we will not charge visitors for stopping by to browse the titles, instead, those who land on the bookcards may attempt to challenge and take possession of a title by trying to answer the next question in Nancy\u2019s Notebook relating to that title. If the challenger answers the question correctly, that player removes the other player\u2019s bookmark and places their own bookmark on the bookcard covering the question number they just answered. \xa0Once all four trivia questions have been answered, the book is removed from the board and added to the \u201cpermanent collection\u201d of the player who answered the final question. \xa0At this point, another bookcard from the library is placed in the empty slot and game play continues. \xa0\n\n\nPlay until there are none left. Clues and Evidence:In the four corners of the board are either question marks (Challenge Clue) or magnifying glasses (Advancing Evidence).If a player lands on one of the question marks (Challenge Clue) that player can try to take a title away from any other player by answering the next question in Nancy\u2019s Notebook relating to that title. \xa0If the challenger answers the question correctly, the challenger removes the other player\u2019s bookmark and places their own bookmark on the bookcard covering the question number that was answered correctly and moves their token to the title from which they will continue to play once it is next their turn. \xa0If that is the 4th question, the challenger may remove the title from the board, add that book to their collection, and replace it with another bookcard from the Library. \xa0If challenger answers the question incorrectly, the challenger leaves their token at the Challenge Clue position on the board on which they originally landed and the challenged player may advance their bookmark forward to the next number on the card corresponding to the question number that the challenger answered incorrectly. \xa0If that is the 4th number, the challenged player may add that book to their collection. \xa0A player who lands on Challenge Clue may also choose to skip or pass on this opportunity to challenge another player.If a player lands on one of the magnifying glasses (Advancing Evidence), they are given an opportunity to answer a question form one of the titles they are currently browsing to advance that title toward their permanent collection. \xa0If the player answers the question correctly, they may move their bookmark forward to the number corresponding with the question they correctly answered and moves their token to the title from which they will continue to play once it is next their turn. \xa0If the player answers the question incorrectly, the player\u2019s bookmark will be removed and the book will be taken off the board, replaced by a new title. In this case, the player leaves their token at the evidence spot on the board on which they originally landed.\n\n\nTo Win:The game continues until all the titles are either removed from play or added to the book collections of the respective players. Player count the number of titles in their collection and the player with the most titles wins.With the money from Kickstarter, I will put my game into production and have it on the shelves in local retail stores as well as be available for online purchase.Finally, thank you to KickVids for providing me with a video for this project!\xa0Video\xa0music by Emeline Easton\n"

The Nancy Drew Board Game is a continuation of the beloved book series, meant to celebrate, and educate kids about, one of literature\u2019s most dynamic characters.\n\nMy name is Quincy MacShane and I am the creator of the Nancy Drew Board Game. Nancy Drew has been an inspiration to me and, I feel, can do the same for other kids. I designed this trivia board game as a fun way for new generations to learn about Nancy Drew and the power of reading.\xa0\n\n\nHelp us launch the Nancy Drew Board Game in time for the 2014 holiday season! \xa0\nNANCY DREW, THE ICON \n\nWhat do Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Barbara Walters, Fran Lebowitz, Laura Bush, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Gayle King, Diane Sawyer, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Congresswoman Pat Schroeder all have in common? They\u2019ve all cited Nancy Drew as having influenced their success. With the Nancy Drew Board Game, a fun an interactive family game experience, I hope to help a new generation of girls\u2014and boys\u2014rediscover Nancy and learn about the series.\nABOUT THE GAME \n\nPut your detective cap on! It's time to get sleuthing.\nThe Nancy Drew Board Game is a fun, educational trivia game designed for 2-4 players, age 8 and up. Players dive into the Nancy Drew universe, learning about the adventures of Nancy Drew as told throughout the 56-book series. The game is designed to support both the power of reading and the power of positive female role models. \n\n\n\nHow to play\nEach player chooses a character\u2014Nancy Drew, George Fayne, Bess Marvin, Ned Nickerson, Dave Evans, Burt Eddleton, Carson Drew, or Hannah Gruen\u2014and a token to move around the board. Ideas for tokens include a magnifying glass, flashlight, and Nancy\u2019s roadster.\xa0\nEach book in the Nancy Drew series has its own card in the game. To start, the 56 bookcards are shuffled and 20 are placed on the gray and black positions around the board.\xa0\n\n\nNancy\u2019s Notebook contains 4 questions for each of the 56 original Nancy Drew books. The first is a multiple-choice question, followed by 3 harder single-answer questions. \xa0\n\n\nNancy\u2019s Notebook contains 4 questions for each of the 56 original Nancy Drew books. The first is a multiple-choice question, followed by 3 harder single-answer questions. If the player answers the trivia question correctly, she receives a bookmark (paperclip) to place over the corresponding question number on the card in play. The player with a bookmark on a bookcard is considered to be \u201cbrowsing\u201d the book. \n\n\nSubsequent players who land on the bookcards may attempt to take possession of a title by trying to answer the next question in Nancy\u2019s Notebook relating to that title. This continues until a player \u201cbuys\u201d the book by answering the fourth and final question related to that book.\xa0\nClues and Evidence\nThe corners of the board feature question marks (Challenge Clue) or magnifying glasses (Advancing Evidence).\nIf a player lands on a Challenge Clue, he can try to win a title from any other player by answering the next question about that title. If a player lands on an Advancing Evidence, he is given an opportunity to answer a question from one of the titles he is currently browsing in order to advance that title toward his permanent collection.\xa0\n\n\nTo win\nPlay continues until all 56 titles are either added to the players\u2019 book collections or removed from play. The player with the most titles wins.\xa0\nWE DID OUR RESEARCH!\xa0\n\nI have thought the Nancy Drew Board Game project through with some good advice from family and friends. I've formed a company, Sutherland Games LLC; licensed the right to produce the game from Simon & Schuster, which has been very supportive of my efforts; submitted a provisional patent around several elements of the game through legal counsel from a Chicago-based firm that specializes in game patents; and am now engaged with a top game production company in Michigan confident that, if we meet our goals, they will be able to fulfill the preliminary orders in time for the upcoming holiday season.\nSPECIAL THANKS\nVideo: KickVids for providing me with a video for this project! \xa0Video music: Emeline Easton\n"

u"\n\n\nNCG-19: Gravitus is a free massive multiplayer online strategy game for PC, Mac and Linux.As a young race in a new galaxy, you have just discovered space travel. You will explore and encounter other player controlled races that you can ally with, declare war on, or simply leave be.You will have access to\nan expansive technology tree containing many buildings, ships and\ncomponents which you must use to the fullest if you want to create the most powerful empire in the galaxy!We plan to have the full game ready to play and rewards ready to be sent out by March 2015 if everything goes well! We will be updating our progress on the game and rewards on a regular basis.Sign up for an account then download the free game and try for yourself!\n\n\n\n\n\nAvailable For\n\n\nGame Engine\n\n\nOur game\nis built using the Unity v.4 engine. We choose the Unity platform for this project because\xa0Unity allows us to save significant time and money over building a from the ground up client side for NCG-19: Gravitus. While at first we were skeptical it has proven to be a great fit for our project.\n\n\nNCG-19 takes place in a\npersistent-world, meaning that when you log out, your colonies and\nships will continue follow the last commands you've given them. Most people don't have\na lot of free time so we designed our game to allow you to play in\nshort bursts of as little as 15 minutes.\n\nScreenshot\n\nNCG-19 challenges you to establish an empire in the cold depths of space. You choose\nproduction for your colonies to expand and make contact with other\nnearby races. The goal is to have the most powerful empire (the\nhighest Networth) at the end of a game season. You can accomplish this\nthrough several means: economic, diplomatic or combat.There are items called Power Cores that are available to find in game. Power Cores are the currency with which you can purchase special skins and models for ships. You will be able to purchase Power Cores from our shop. Power Cores can also be used to give boosts to ships and colonies and to level up Captains.\n\nThe game uses a circle-of-advantage mechanic for combat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlayers are given the choice between three basic race\nmodels, then they choose racial modifications from a list\nof attributes. These attributes range from bonuses to income and\nresearch to enhanced planetary tolerances to combat modifiers. This\nis done only once upon creation of a unique race.\n\n\nCaptains are special units with a set of attributes that can level\nup. They have a wide range of abilities and powers which can also\nlevel up. When Captains are assigned to ships, they will increase the\neffectiveness of their ship and potentially the rest of the fleet as\nwell. There are seven classes of Captain, each having unique\nabilities.\n\n\nThere are many types and sizes of planets that players can colonize. Some planets will be more beneficial to them than others due to varying gravity and radiation. Colonies produce buildings and ships, and will grow in population if they are cared for.\n\n\nA player's colony has three kinds of jobs that can be performed by each unit of population. Players can choose at any time to switch a worker to a new job, thereby altering the output of the colony.\n\n\nA player's fleet of ships will engage an enemy fleet in open combat where ships are paired and fight until one side is destroyed. Success is modified by ship type, weapon type and defensive components. When colonies are attacked, they can retaliate provided they have a planetary defence structure.\n\n\nPlayers will have a Command Point total that will determine the number of ships they can have under their control. This total can be increased in various ways.\n\n\nShips come in many sizes with varying amounts of room for components and weapons. Weapons and components each take a specific amount of room and so ships can be tailored to each player's specific needs.\n\n\nShips can be grouped together for ease of movement when players are moving between planets or stars. Ships will also engage in battle as a fleet, giving players more tactical options in war.\n\n\nAt this point, only a basic level of the tech tree is implemented. Players have a variety of buildings and ship types to choose from, but we are in the process of expanding on this material.\n\n\nPlayers have access to an in-game communications feature\nwhich allows them to send and receive messages with their friends and\nenemies.\n\n\nPlayers can declare war on each other, make peace and make\nalliances.\xa0Alliances\nhave private in game message boards for strategy and providing help.\n\n\nPlayers receive log of each battle, indicating ships that were destroyed, how they were destroyed and which enemy ship\ndestroyed them.

Specific ship components\nare required to capture other ships, but all players can capture colonies.\n\n\nEach player\xa0has a number called their Networth that is determined by the overall value of their empire. Penalties are given to players who attack others who are too much lower in Networth, while attacking a higher Networth player can result in bonuses.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMillennia ago there was\nan ancient galaxy containing three great races.The\nMachines: Little is known of the true origins of these\nmineral and metal based machines, but any who have witnessed them\nliterally devour a planet know of their true power.The\nBio-Swarm: Birthed in their former galaxy from a spore\npod send through the depths of space, this race has evolved into\ndurable, nightmarish creatures able to shape their environments and\nbring terrible fear to those who oppose them.The\nTerrans: Evolved on a planet similar to Earth, this\nrace of carbon-based life forms was able to reach for the stars in a\nfar shorter time-span than their peers due to their innate creativity\nand desire to understand.Each race discovered\ninterstellar travel and began to colonize planets far from home, and\nthey quickly found they weren't alone.\xa0At first there were\nhostilities between them, but over time the races came to several\nagreements.\xa0Among these: in order\nto avoid encroaching on each others territory, efforts would begin to\nreach nearby galaxies and settle there.A survey of nearby\ngalaxies found 23 that were suitable.

Software and hardware costs have come down, allowing for more developers to get started in their projects.We started almost two years ago and have been working evenings and weekends since then to make our game become a reality. We finally reached the point where our expenses for the game became too much to handle with our day jobs, so we have brought NCG-19: Gravitus to Kickstarter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMusic:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 $2000 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0 Emergency Fund: $2000Art:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 $7000 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Rewards:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 $6000Programming: $8000 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0 Server Costs:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 $2000Writing:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 $3000 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0 Unity License:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 $1200Marketing:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 $2000 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Fees:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 $3320----------------------------------------------------------------------------Total:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 $36,520\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$37,500\nEvery player will get to create a custom icon from a selection of\ngraphics and colours that will be available.

u'\n*Video explains the project:Kindly read about our organization, who we are, why we do what we do, and how we will make this project a success.Greetings!\n\xa0We hope you enjoyed our project video. We think the main point is clear.\xa0We\'ve been busy gathering together the resources, the right minds and efficient coders. \nWe raised seed funds using personal investments utilizing our faith in this as the prudent way to start. It took some doing (www.organic-ese.com) but it\'s not complete.\xa0We hope you will rally around this increasingly popular cause as we approach the Fall semester. With assistance from you we can complete the project with the quality that we demand.\n\n\nWe were founded by like-minded individuals, good friends really, with advanced degrees in different fields; an economist, an organic chemist, a coding prodigy, a mathematician and together we\'ve created a business model and computer methods tested in collaboration with our European partners. This is about more than helping educate people about one kind of chemistry.\xa0To watch the potent effect on the individual and appreciate the personalized scale of this resource for students as it develops, we know that grasping the big picture and getting on the same wavelength via a dialog (two-way) must exist.Make serious science into a cartoon? That\'s no joke. Learn it with a video game? That\'s the app we\'ve built, proprietized and are refining.Rich factual content that has something familiar or pleasant about it. Studying is after all just a process of conditioning oneself...and alternatives work better than nothing which, intentional or not, is all most receive for their thousands in tuition...1000 pages of fluff you have to sort through on your own.\xa0Why do we crush student dreams near the end of their educational careers?\xa0Do you find this hilariously infuriating?We hope to launch all the chemistry services for the Fall semester. We can then know how best to prepare for spring. For that to happen, we depend on your generosity and your understanding of the issue we want to make irrelevant.Just the beginning:\n\xa0The rapid dissemination of knowledge is reality. Knowledge should be free, access should be universal and we\'re out to change the curriculum, not to share our ideas about it. When it\'s the next generation\'s future, we need people good at science but more than that we need well-rounded individuals. These make the best physicians, managers and leaders. Human capital is what AvidMind focuses on. We can\'t rely on manufacturing and natural resources anymore without better ideas.\xa0We can rely though, on creativity and brainpower. Let\'s shift the focus toward increasing our mental capital and capacity. Education is something worth far more than we ever pay for it, and is invariably under-supplied for that reason. Investment in education and new learning methods (for both man and machine) can offer returns that can\'t be appreciated at this stage but is our best and only realistic hope.\n\n\nNo excuses for why you didn\'t become the greatest doctor, astronaut or chemist will exist. In traditional organic courses, things are taught in rigid, backward and often counter-productive ways. There is nothing so mind-numbing in chemistry to stop you from grasping it. Nothing that can\'t be explained to a 16 year old in a few sentences. It\'s supposedly the hardest class of all and we explain why this is so on our website.Often there\'s no teaching method in place. Some professors just "wing" the whole thing. This is not only insane it will set you up to fail. It is unfair. Organic chemistry doesn\'t weed people out....the presentation of it does. If you\'ve not already heard about these stories, do a quick search for organic chemistry anxiety and/or hell for premeds. The only tool you really have, the textbook, is overload in our opinion and getting bigger and costlier by the year. You can use a 10-year-old book and get the same exact knowledge. That\'s the truth. Aren\'t you sick of the obscene cost of textbooks that have nothing more substantive to offer? If people just put those resources into an alternative, things will change.Kickstarter and generous individuals will benefit students and therefore society. Since our concepts are based on computational analyses, we reach actionable results with statistical precision. More than that, we have created novel applications and devices to meet consumer demand in other areas with the educational psychology to motivate, not to brainwash.\xa0We\'ve done something remarkable here with this and other projects in a few months and that\'s how certain we are our organization will be part of the future.\n\n\nWith much needed funding, we will be able to overcome our first and primary obstacle. We\'ll just move on to the next problem. We\'ve compiled a prioritized list. Among these is one mystery, in particular, we\'re just biting our nails about. Despite rigorous efforts to disprove what are undeniable observations, we\'ve discovered something real and persistent in nature. It\'s mathematically and computationally intensive. It will be worth study as it directly seems to effect each and every person on the planet. Our future projects extend far beyond our science website and may eventually answer some of our oldest questions about the nature of reality and human life.\xa0Sound like a lot? We can technically patent it right now but wish to make sure this is no fluke. So far, nothing can cause its failure to persist. It defies logic and cannot be falsified (the point of scientific experiment).We love this work....and do it because we simply want to know. We want answers...now.\xa0Collaboration is the key to success. It\'s the heart of our business model along with applied and reputable science. We need, designers, artists, coders, support staff and sorely needed updates to our equipment. We need to optimize our methods further until we reach the answer.Our \'semester\' starts with your semester. Ironically, we and you both have a month to to prepare, more than enough time.\n\n\nJoin our cause! We\'ve seen this project work during testing on real students. That\'s what we did for years. Easy solutions to "intractable" questions. We just need to speed things up with more hands on deck. \xa0\nWe will soon present a project that may interest some..but on inspection is relevant and affects everyone. Together, let\u2019s change the way education is perceived. Are you in? \xa0\n'

u'\n  We hope you enjoyed the video.\nDo you find this situation hilariously infuriating? We do.We\'re the founders of this project, Dave and Stefan. We have terminal knowledge in different fields and collaboration with other talented people with a passion to create and to educate. What\'s our plan?We\'re out to build a virtual tutor app for mobile devices and an animated video series.\n\nDave and Stefan - Project Managers\n\nTogether we\'ve created a business plan and computer methods tested in collaboration with our European partners.\xa0The science curriculum crushes students\' dreams near the end of their formal education.Yes, it\'s true. But there are ways around that. We\'ve gathered the resources, the right minds and experienced coders. \nWe raised seed funds using personal investment put our faith in a terrific concept. The website is up (www.organic-ese.com) and is filling up with resources.\xa0How we spend your generous funding.We can finish the project, we have the ideas, and the access we just need working funds to solve this decades-long problem on the first attempt. The website is in its final stages.\xa0We need to complete the app and the video series to have the virtual tutor fully completed.The intro video above is unlike the real video series. The videos we want will be in 3-D and like the app will star your online study buddy:\n\nDr.Azulene\n\nThis requires coding time and more staff. Nothing however is out of our reach.\nThis project is about much more than one class. This is the start of an interactive tool with countless potential genres and markets.Odds are someone you know will require help in organic chemistry.\xa0You may not need the virtual tutor but your niece or your college-aged kids wants and needs this, Students pay for supplements, books and help guides before reading the textbook. You must pass through this subject to become a surgeon, physician, dentist, dietician, nutritionist, nurse, biochemist, patent law consultant, pharmacist, science writer or editor, chemist scientific consultant..and so on.\xa0The best way to make that happen is with a tutor. That\'s $25-80 dollars an hour. Why pay by the hour to study at someone else\'s pace?\xa0Instead a virtual tutor that you can help make reality...think about the convenience. Even get tutoring on the bus or in your pajamas.\n\n\n\xa0Together, we want motivated students to grasp the big picture. Getting on the same wavelength via a two-way dialog is the only way.\xa0Just the beginning:\n\xa0Knowledge should be free, access should be universal and we\'re out to change the curriculum, not to share our ideas about it. We need the next generation to excel at science but more than that we need well-rounded individuals. These make the best physicians, managers and leaders.\xa0\n\n\nNo excuses for why you didn\'t become the greatest doctor, astronaut or chemist will exist. All the information is out there on the reputable sites like Wikipedia...but it doesn\'t help. It makes it worse, actually.In traditional organic courses, things are taught in rigid, backward and often counter-productive ways. There is nothing so mind-numbing in chemistry to stop you from grasping it. Nothing that can\'t be answered in a few sentences. It\'s supposedly the hardest class of all and we explain why this is so on our website.The Textbook is a Pain to ReadThe textbook is the only tool you really can depend on. But frankly, it\'s a piece of...it sucks. It\'s overload in our opinion and getting bigger and costlier by the year. You can use any 10-year-old book and get the same knowledge. It\'s true. New textbooks cost a fortune but contain nothing significantly more helpful than the last one. A new cover? ..yippee.If people just put those resources into a permanent alternative, things will change. Read any textbook of your choice after you understand the fundamental skills needed to do problems independently. Dr.Azulene will translate it for you.\n\n\nThat\'s our focus for the app and the video series, to prepare you to study alone.Why Professor\'s Still Can\'t Teach the SubjectOften there\'s no teaching method in place. Some professors just "wing" the whole thing. This is not only insane it will set you up to fail. It is also unfair.\xa0Reality:\xa0Organic chemistry doesn\'t weed people out....the presentation of it does.

u"\nHi, I'm Dave, also known as El Davo and I'm an artist from Folkestone, Kent.The ProjectI have spent the last 2 months working on a project to create a mural for the local community in the buzzing seaside town of Folkestone. Despite putting all my time into it, I have fallen short on fundraising and I'm looking towards the kind people of Kickstarter to help me reach my target. At this stage, \xa3500 might just about do that. Please see below for how I intend to spend this money!\nThe design is based on the illustration shown here, but with revisions made to make it suitable for scaling up onto a large wall. Also, in place of the metallic, munching ball will be a bass-guitar instead. Noel Redding's bass-guitar to be precise. It will have the vine wrapping round it, almost consuming it. Below are close-ups of the updated sketches for the design.The location is next to Noel's Yard, Folkestone. A pocket of Folkestone behind Googies Art Caf\xe9 that has recently undergone a creative refurbishment. The Noel's Yard project is being led by Googies & Friends.\xa0For those that donate \xa325 or more you will receive an A5, limited edition, signed screen-print of my bird illustration which will be found in the mural (like a game of Where's Wally!). It will be of a similar style to the birds uploaded recently to my Facebook page (www.facebook.com/eldavoart).\xa0The design will be put through the screen printing process and printed by hand onto high quality art paper. I will limit this run based on how many people are backing this project so that it remains exclusive to you.\nHow the money will be spent.\xa0\nThere are 2 main things I'd like to put this money towards.\n- The scaffolding because unfortunately my arms aren't anywhere near 8 metres long!\xa0\xa0:(\n-The volunteers. They have been kind enough to offer their time and expect nothing in return. However, I would like to show my appreciation by paying them what I can.

u'\nDear Backers,Thank you for taking interest in our cause. Pink Aprons is committed to improving the food quality standards for kids. We are looking to service schools, daycare centers, and summer programs in the Greater Chicagoland Area. We are passionate about making a change, servicing our community, and providing meals that are both\xa0affordable and healthy for the nourishment of children\'s bodies and minds. Below is our plans for how to use the funds you pledge:\nCurrently Pink Aprons is approved to service summer programs, daycare centers, and private schools. Funds from the campaign will be used to get the licensing required to be eligible to bid for contracts to get into Chicago Public Schools.

u'\nIts been a rough few years for me. I have moved out on own. Failed school because of wrong choices in my past. Have had multiple jobs to survive. What I always had was the capability to enjoy making roses. I finally got out of my struggle and\xa0 found my passion for business marketing. I found a school where I\xa0 was able to have outstanding grades only issue, as every college student has,money. So here I am posting myself out for the public and hoping to make my dream officially true. At the end of my business career, I wish to not only make awesome kind heart managers as a business professor but my own coffee shop where I can bring in others arts and crafts and help them expand their dreams and provide tea and coffee to the world with a smile. So they start their morning right. But to achieve that, I must go through the small step first and here is my small step. So become part of my small step. \n'
Current:
u"\nWe have all been there. Where money is tight and you wanna put down your lucky numbers and see if you can win big. But the lottery doesn't save you. Turns out your weren't that one in million. Turns out the hopes of being in school start to turn into a negative cloud hanging over your head. You know you gotta earn the money to get there but waiting forever on those paychecks takes time. I am here because I am going through and have been going through. The current constantly washing over me feeling like I wont make it to my dream. As a business major this site shows hope. I want to earn the money back and its way I am willing to slave myself to roses creations just to bring a hint of beauty to you for donating to my cause. To make you feel as beautiful as I do the minute I get a donation because its one step closing to being able to finish my dream. This money honestly goes to my education fund. No ifs, ands, or buts. Maybe I'm not making amazing jewelry and maybe a duck pen rose is not the most exciting thing in world but its from the heart of a thankful girl just trying to get her education on.\n"

u"\nThe project and the about me really go hand in hand since I am the project. With the game of golf I have had more downs than ups with this game yet still cling to the possibility that I could play this game at the highest level. Right now with the cost of a good set of clubs being so high and working nights on an hourly wage it really doesn't cover the cost of being able to purchase them. This would be the first step on my road to becoming a Tour Professional. With the new set of clubs I would be able to start getting my golf game in order again. The reason I do not have clubs at the moment was that I was working at a golf course but with cost of living being so high all my money went to bills and food with one particularly bad month and unexpected bills I had to sell my golf clubs. My main goal is being able to acquire a sponsor to start playing the professional mini tours. These are also very expensive being you might need $40-50,0000 for year covering cost of living, play/practice time, traveling, coaching etc.... any money I receive over the cost of the equipment will go to pay for tournaments etc..\xa0 I am 33 years old, and have had a roller coaster of a time with golf in my life. I didn't get into the game till I was about 18. I got my handicap very low in my early 20s and did not play in college. I started playing the mini tours in Southern California when my then ex girlfriend decided to steal everything I own and leave me penniless. I decided to move out to AZ where my family was and start over, another time in my life where I had no golf clubs the game was forgotten for the next 7 years where I got into sales. What brought me back was when I went out and shot 71 first time on a golf course in almost a decade. I quit my sales job and got a job at a golf course. Playing and practicing I was able to get my game down to a +3 handicap and shooting mid 60s to low 70s consistently. The problem was that I had no money for tournaments and no contacts for a sponsor. Now here I am today, I gave up on golf over a year ago frustrated but it has never left my mind. I watch the television coverage every week dreaming I was there. This is pretty much one of my last shots at doing something. Thank you very much!\n"

REED: Strong and empathetic\xa01st Lt Alexa Reed uses the memories of her last and only months with new husband Ryan as strength to hold her (and Duchamp) though the torture. "You haven\'t the strength to break me, and it amuses me to watch you try."Episode 2. SCRIBE:\xa0Quiet Officer Cadet Jimmy \'SCRIBE\' Thomas dropped out of University, giving up a promising future broadcast career and signed up shortly after the war broke, deciding: \u201cit wasn\'t enough to report on the tragedy when I\xa0could help to stop it." Near fatally injured during the crash Scribe, through his camera, acts as a voice of narration to the events leading up to the P.O.W camp.Episode 3. CAP:\xa0As the most senior surviving officer of the P.O.Ws and a military legacy; Captain Andrew \'Cap\' James defiantly tries to protect and lead his unit to escape. "I am not my father, nor my grandfather, I may carry the name but I stand on my own merit."Episode 4. DUCHAMP: Bubbly, young American Private Casey Duchamp joined\xa0thinking the army to be the best place to escape a bad past and set up a new future, never anticipated a war would break out and finds herself in way over her head. "They said \'join up, be all you can be\'; I never wanted to be this!" Now she relies on Reed to help her through...Episode 5. COOK:\xa0Laid back, slightly crazy, Australian Officer Cadet Jesse \'Cook\' Kelly has \'bummed\' around his whole life before discovering that in the Army he could: \u201ctravel the world and get paid to kick the crap out of Assholes, who wouldn\'t love that job!\u201d. \xa0But the longer he is held in the \xa0POW camp, Cook slowly begins to crack.Episode 6. LUCKY:\xa0The final P.O.W 2nd Lt. Billy \'Lucky\' Robin is "Lucky by name, Lucky by nature, that\'s me". Surviving everything life could throw at him and always coming out on top, could Lucky\'s \'luck\' finally run out?...\n'

u"\nSERIES FORMATArticle IV: The POW\xa0Chronicles\xa0is a six part anthology mini series chronicling the\xa0torture and escape attempts of POWs. The material draws from real accounts from major wars throughout history.\xa0Season One follows six captured soldiers in an Iraqi POW camp during the Persian Gulf War. Each episode follows the point of view of a different soldier during their time of imprisonment, viewing their backstory through flashbacks and their struggles to survive torture up until their deaths.\xa0Throughout the series, character story lines will overlap and interweave as timelines cross, giving an insight into the full story via differing characters accounts.FLIP FORMAT TVThis is an audio visual arrangement, breaking the popular linear storytelling model as it follows a series of events told through six different points of view.\xa0It's designed to capitalise on the current \u2018binge watching craze\u2019, the series model is edited into pieces; with each episodic account showing a little more, enticing the audience to piece together the full accounts through the varying stories.Show creator, Ry\u2019Lei Hudson-Westchester says about the project, \u201cI wanted to deliver something completely fresh and unseen. Not just in the story, but the way the story was told. To me I felt the uniqueness of the idea, basing a series about Prisoners of War within a P.O.W camp needed a very unique delivery so I created Flip Format Television Programming to honor the truth of it justly.\u201dCHARACTERS\nLt.

The Actual Name Will Be Revealed Closer to The Release Date.I Have Been Planning Valhalla For Many Years Now, But Because Of My Lack Of Programming Knowledge, I Have Been Continuously Been Putting Off Development, And Have Instead Been Planning On My Own.Finally I Have Decided That I Want To Get A Team Together And Work Towards Making My Dream A Reality.Funds Will Go Towards Paying For This Team, And Ensuring They Have The Tools Required To Perform To The Best Of Their Abilities.2.

Spend Your Time Fishing, Cooking, Exploring Or Shaping The Land. Build Anything You Can Dream Of On Your Personal Island, Or Just Hang Out By The Beach.=====================================================3. SKILLS AND STATSThere Are Currently 33 Planned Skills, And All Players Will Be Able To Level Any Of The Skills At Any Time By Doing Activities Which Give Experience To The Skill.Skills Will Directly Influence What You Can Do In The World, And How Well You Can Do It. (For Example, Cooking Better Quality Food Will Require The Player To Have Dedicated Some Time To Raise Their Cooking Skills)There Are Combat Skills, Gathering Skills, Crafting Skills, And Also General Skills.COMBAT SKILLSThere Are 8 Combat Skills.Each Of These Skills Affect 2 To 3 Of The Players Stats (This May Sound Complicated, But It Is Actually Very Easy To Understand.)Combat Skills Also Affect The Players Combat Level. (This Is Pretty Much The Level Of Your Character, Which Will Be Seen By Other Players.)STATSThere Are 12 Stats, With 11 Of These Being Influenced By The 8 Combat Skills. The Last Stat\xa0Charisma Is Influenced By Player Progression In Quests, Achievements, Events On Their Island, And Other Methods.Stats Directly Relate To How Much Health And Mana The Player Has, Along With How Much Damage They Can Do And Avoid.GATHERING SKILLSThere Are Currently 5 Gathering Skills.Using These Skills, Players Can Gather Resources From The World Which They Can Use For Crafting Skills.

(Example: Cooking Food, Making Furniture, Making Equipment)GENERAL SKILLSThere Are Currently 9 General Skills.These Skills Are Used For Fun, Or Assisting With Other Skills. (Example: Composition Allows The Player To Write Their Own Music, And Play It Ingame)=======================================================4. THE GAME WORLDThere Will Be A Lot To Do In Valhalla.\xa0A Players Time Will Generally Be Spent Leveling Skills, Exploring The World, Completing Quests And Achievements, Working With Other Players, Exploring Dungeons, Fighting Monsters, And Managing Their IslandPLAYER ISLANDI Wanted To Start With With Player Islands Because They Are A Feature I Am Very Excited About.On A Players Island, Players Will Have the Freedom To Shape It To Anything They Want.This Includes:\xa0\nShaping The Land.\xa0\nPlanting and Removing Trees And Other Plants.\xa0\nBuilding Facilities, Houses, Decorations, Etc.\nInteracting With NPC\nPlayers Will Also Be Able To Build Houses For NPCs Which Will Interact With The Player In Various Ways, Such As Socializing, Giving Quests, And Other Interesting Events. (Basically You Will Be Taking Care Of Your Villagers, And In Return They May Give The Player Gifts, Or Even Do Jobs For The Player Such As Gathering Resources.)Players Will Have Full Control Of Their Island, Including Who Can Visit, And What They Can And Can't Do While They Are There. (By Default Anyone Can Visit, But They Will Not Be Able To Do Anything Except Explore)QUESTS AND ACHIEVEMENTSThere Will Be Many Quests And Achievements In Valhalla.QUESTSQuests Tell The Story Of The Player, \xa0The History Of Valhalla, And Those Living There. Quests Can Be Accepted And Completed In Any Order. (The Only Exception To This Is When A Quest Requires That Another Quest Or Group Of Quests Be Completed Before It Can Be Accepted.)All Quests Can Be Accepted As Long As It's Requirements Are Met.Requirements Usually Include Having The Right Skill Levels, Have Completed The Required Quests, Having A Specific Item, Etc.ACHIEVEMENTSPlayers Earn Achievements As They Play The Game.Achievements Can Be Very Easy To Get Or Very Hard. Better Rewards Are Given Depending On How Difficult The Achievement Is.(Rewards Can Be Titles, Items, Mounts, Unique Crafting Options, Etc.)MONSTERSPlayers Kill Monsters For Quests, Drops, And Achievement.But the Main Reason Players Kill Monsters Is To Level Up Their Combat Skills.Monsters Come In All Shapes And Sizes.Some Won't Attack Unless Provoked, Others Will Only Attack If Your Combat Level Is The Same Or Lower Than Their Own, And Some Will Always Attack You At Any Level.There Are Different Classes Of Monster.~Standard Monster. (This Is The Most Common Monster Found Everywhere)~Boss Monster. (These Are Usually Found, During Quests, Or Roaming The World.)~Rare Monster (These Appear Randomly In Random Locations.)~Elite Monster (These Are Usually Found In Dungeons, and Have Slightly Higher Stats Than Normal Monsters.)~Elite Boss (These Are Usually Found Inside Dungeons And Are Often The Strongest Enemy.)~Elite Rare (These World Bosses Appear Randomly In A Number Of Locations. They Often Require Multiple Players to Defeat.)DUNGEONSThere Are 2 Kinds Of Dungeons.\xa0~Standard Dungeon (This Is The Standard Dungeon. The Layout Of These Dungeons Does Not Change, But The Monsters It Can Contain May Change Each Visit.)~Random Dungeon (This Is The Random Dungeon. In This Dungeon, Both the Layout And Monsters Will Change Each Visit.)Dungeons Provide Slightly Better Experience For Combat Skills, And May Provide Some Experience For Other Skills. (Also Each Dungeon Rewards The Player With A Completion Reward.)EXPLORING THE WORLDApart From The Player Islands Mentioned Earlier, Players Can Visit Many Other Locations Including Various Other Islands, and The Mainland.The Mainland Is Where Most Of The Large Cities Are Located.On The Mainland You Will Find A Variety Of Different Climates, Races, Scenery, And Interesting Characters.=======================================================5. PLAYERSAs You Already Know, Players Have Access To 33 Skills.I Have Also Covered Stats. So Now It Is Time To Discuss The Player.\nThere Are No Set Classes. Because Of This, A Player Will Gain Skills Depending On What Weapon/s They Are\xa0Wielding, And The Level Of Their Combat\xa0Skill Levels (Defensive Skills Work The Same Way, But Using Armor Instead Of Weapon)This Allows Players To Change Their Method Of Attack Between Battles Easily. (They Can Fight As A Tanky Warrior In One Battle, And Fight As A Mage In The Next, Just With A Change Of Equipment.) This Makes It Easy To Fight Multiple enemies With Different Weaknesses.\nPlayers Will Only Have 1 Character Slot. (This May Change Based On Feedback) Personally I Feel 1 Character Is All You Will Need. (There Is No Real Advantage To Having More Than One Character, Except Joining Multiple Guilds, ETC.)\nPlayer Data Will Be Shared Between Servers. This means That You Can Play the Same Character On All Servers, And jump Servers At Will.I Plan To Have Multiple Servers At Various Locations Worldwide. (At First I Will Only Have A Few Servers, But Will Add More As The Player Base Grows.)(At First, Servers Will Most Likely Be Located In Australia, And the US.)\n=======================================================6. CONCLUSIONThese Are Just a Few Of The Things I Have Planned.\xa0As You Can See There Is Plenty To Do In Valhalla, And This Is Just The Beginning.During Development I Will Provide More Information, And Keep Everyone Updated With The Progress. (Keep In Mind That Some Things Will Not Be Revealed Until The Right Time.)Thanks For Reading This Far.I Also Want To Give A Big Thank You To All Current And Future Backers, You Guys Really Make A Difference.\n"

u'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoyen is a family business. The company was born when my husband and I met. I knitted hats on my own and would sell them on the ski centres to finance my career. We are both architects. When my husband, Felipe, saw my hats, he fell in love with them and that is how Poyen was created. Soon after, we moved to the coast of Chile to have a better quality of life. Poyen was our first child, a way to be independent and also help our community. \nThe company has existed for over six years, as a work alternative for me as I have had to prioritize raising my two children, work from home, and at the same time, always trying to innovate and help other women without the same opportunities that I have had.\xa0\nHowever, this year, we had a bad experience in the retailing market which has set Poyen back, but we do not want to abandon this project or the women that we have helped. That is why we need your help; to kick-start Poyen again, and reach out even further.\nThank you so much for your support \xa1\xa1\nIsa\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe like to go very far, here our reasons and dreams\n\n\n\n\nOur impact reaches children , \xa0at-risk women, helps to improve their education, their health, which consequently brings long-term benefits, trying to reduce social differences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\xa0\n'

u'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi my name is Isa and I would like to introduce you to Poyen. In mapudungan, one of Chiles native languages Poyen means Love. Poyen is a family company.  Born out of necessity and of course Love.In the beginning to fund my studies as an architect I was knitting hats and selling them in the local Chilean ski resorts. When my husband, Felipe also an architect, first saw my hats, he fell in love and thus our first child Poyen was born. Soon after, we moved Maitencillo on the Pacific coast to have a better quality of life away from the hustle and bustle of the city. We saw Poyen as a way to be independent and also to help and connect with the community.In the years that followed we saw the birth of our next two children. Poyen has given me the opportunity to work from home and be there to see them grow. As Poyen has blossomed over the last 6 years we have sought the help of local ladies in the community, ladies that have grown up without the opportunities that we have had. Their craftsmanship is amazing and they are as grateful as we are for the opportunity to work together, it is a win win situation. This last year however we had a major setback, and not wanting to abandon Poyen, our first baby, or the amazing women that have helped us along the way we are asking your help to kick-start Poyen again, and reach out even further.Thank you for your support!!! Isa, Felipe, Poyen and every one of our women knitters Families.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe like to go very far, here our reasons and dreams\n\n\n\n\nOur impact reaches children , \xa0at-risk women, helps to improve their education, their health, which consequently brings long-term benefits, trying to reduce social differences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\xa0\n'

u'\nPlease like this page :) It\'s the least you could do and we would be very\xa0thankful! :)We restarted the post because the first one failed\xa0miserably.. The big sum of\xa0money (7000 euro) was FAKE (Added by a friend as a joke, without we knowing so) and so we only got 2 euro.. We do still want to make this game happen so here is version 2.0 of PARTICULE KICKSTARTER!\n\n\nParticule is a survival game with multiplayer, arcade survival, and an awesome campaign.\xa0The project, designed by Plutonium Game Studio\'s, is designed to bring the best survival game experience on your mobile Andriod or iOs phones. It features a top-down view, with 3D elements. It features vehicles, a lot of weapons, Mass multiplayer with server hosting with a max of 120 players on 1 server at a time (!), a powerful, custom engine (The Apocalypse Engine), A massive campaign full of relatable\xa0characters, Factions, choices, betrayal and mysteries. The game is not made for pure income, but for the best experience. That\'s why DLC\'s are FREE.\n\n\n\xa0Why invest in Particule? What makes it so different?Well, we\'ve made a list just to tell you ;)\nThe game runs on a powerful custom engine, very cheap, fast and easy to upgrade.\nThe game is simple, lag-free, beautiful and very cheap.\nIt has FREE dlc\'s! That means, that when a new map will come out, everyone will get it for FREE!\nCross platform\xa0to ALL the platforms.\nPrivate hosting\nA\xa0choice\xa0for cross-platform servers(unfair) or platform servers(fair)\nVO-ip (Talk in the game to\xa0each other!)\nRealism! Drugs like EPO increase performance for running and doubles blood\xa0regeneration. A car crash will add severe\xa0bleeding\'s, with\xa0a\xa0concussion\xa0time.\nCars, helicopters, bikes,\xa0motorcycles etc\nMassive unscripted multiplayer MMO servers with support for 120+ players!\nA lot of weapons! We focus to reach 100 different weapons\nFood, drinks, fuel, medicine, drugs! We focus to reach 50 different items!\nOffline arcade survival! Survive as long as you can against hordes of zombies!\nMini-games!\nAchievements on the native "Game center", or locally if not supported.\nShow off your achievements with awesome multiplayer hats!\n10+ hours of dynamic campaign that will be different depending on your\xa0choices\xa0and random events! No play-run\xa0will\xa0ever be the same!\nA story in every corner. The massive map will have a LOT of personal story\'s hidden\xa0throughout\xa0it\'s streets. They may be touching, or very brave and inspiring. However, they will be fun to figure out!\nA lot... LOT of\xa0Easter\xa0eggs!\n\n\nWhat makes the campaign so special? It is a 10+ hour campaign, that can be replayed as much times as you want, and each time will give you a different experience, thanks to random events and choices. The campaign is written by a professional writer, to get the most touching, most awesome campaign we could bring to your phone, console, Pc, Mac or Linux computer. \xa0There will be added a lot of secrets in the campaign to extend the replay value even MORE.\n\n\nThe multiplayer is going to be different from the arcade survival. Unlike the survival, the multiplayer features weak zombies which are no treat at all. The real threat are the other players. When you meet other players, you can not be sure if they are friendly or not, so you need to be careful. You can either co-operate against the infected and murderers, or fight against each other to steal the loot of the bloodied corpses. The multiplayer and survival world will feature a massive open world.\n\n\nThe survival mode is a classic arcade. The infected will grow stronger and faster after time passes. It is your task to survive as long as you can. It is kinda like multiplayer, but with more and stronger "zombies". It requires no internet, so you can even play it when you are waiting in the line for the dentist!\n\n\nSPOILERS!Follow in Pjotr\'s footsteps after he wakes up of a coma in Russia. While he wanders the streets to uncover what happened and to find a secure hiding spot, he meets a lot of characters.\xa0The infected are not ordinary zombies. They are a failed experiment to make humans immortal. The goal was to make a cancer that would replace all the cells of the human with immortal ones. The only problem was, that the memory also got replaced ones in a while, what caused extreme fear and anger to other humans. One test subject escaped and managed to infect others with transmitting the cancer in the blood trough a bite. The infected humans began to be eaten away with the cells, completely changing them into infected zombies.\n\n\nParticule is made to run on a solid 30 FPS on a Iphone 4. Anything close to that or higher-end will run the game fine to give the best experience. If you still experience lag, you can adjust some features that requires some processing like less tiling, mipmapping, fog, dynamic shaders, lighting etc.\n\n\nPlutonium Game Studio\'s\nFounder and CEO: Ricky van Swaal\nManager: Mads Mohnem\nProgrammer: Ricky van Swaal\nStory writer: Mads Mohnem\nArtist 1: Luc Redmond\nArtist 2: Marwan Fadel\nMusical artist: ErikMMusic\nPlaytester 1: Marwan Fadel\nPlaytester 2: ErikMMusic\nPlaytester 3: Ethan Ord\nWe would also like to thank everyone who donated and looked at the page.

u"\nIn the past I've suffered from depression and anxiety. I went through years of suffering and it was through love, support, fantastic doctors and counselors that I finally made it to where I am today. I'm alive and I'm happy to be alive. After my recovery I spent plenty of time reflecting on what my past life experiences have done. All of my sorrow, pain, and suffering were not for naught. My experiences made me who I am today. A kind, caring, compassionate person who is always willing to lend an ear. I've used my experiences to help others through their emotional turmoil and I had hoped to be able to find a place where people who were suffering could reach out to those who were there to listen. I must say that I found those places but they came at such a staggering cost. People don't want to pay for help and they shouldn't have to pay for help. They should be able to get the help they need without having to bear any additional financial burden.When you're depressed, or suffering any type of mental anguish, it can be a challenge just to get out of bed in the morning. Some sufferers cannot go to work and therefore have limited income and resources to spend on their mental health.My dream is to help those people. This community will rely on people with kind hearts to listen to those who need it. Some of the supporters will be counselors, some won't, some will have a history of depression, some won't, but one thing they will all have in common is the willingness to listen for FREE.Help make this dream a reality. Help us help those in need!\n"

u'\nJoin us in the fight against depression and suicide. Counseling services can cost a small fortune, and, for many, that cost is not an option. A shortage of funds can be a huge barrier to people suffering with depression. Another barrier to recovery is the unwillingness to speak, face to face, about feelings of depression and thoughts of suicide. Our goal is to offer FREE online counseling services to those in need. No catches, hidden fees, or trial subscriptions. Just 100% free, unbarred access to counselors and a community of people who care about each other and are just there to help. In short, we\'re trying to save lives. In order to do that, we need to join hands and raise them up in the fight against depression and suicide. In recent years, depression is becoming less and less taboo but it is still a touchy issue and many people don\'t believe it exists. Admissions of depression are often met with discouraging statements like "get over it" or "it\'s all in your head". While depression may be a mental affliction, it can have very real, and serious, physical effects.\xa0Without access to help, many people do not recover from depression. An alarming number of sufferers go on to make a suicide attempt. Unfortunately, some of these attempts are successful. If only they knew that there was someone out there willing to listen. Our goal is to create a community of listeners. A community that can hold hands and work together to get people suffering from depression on the road to recovery. We want to create a community that is LOUDER than depression. We want to stand on the rooftops and shout:"WE ARE HERE! WE WILL LISTEN! DEPRESSION IS REAL!"This fight starts with, and ends with, you. Join us. Join us and we can win in this fight against depression and suicide. You don\'t have to donate to help, just share this Kickstarter and add your story to the comments. You\'re not alone! Nobody else should be either.\n'

We decided to join forces, combining our skills and experiences.\xa0After a busy period spent developing the concept, the first \xab Quinoa \xbb collection was born in December 2013, through our desire to design items that are easy to move, to store and most of all last in time.Our philosophy:\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\nQuinoa reflects an ethical conception, particularly through the choice of materials. Each family member is crafted with certified veg-tan or recycled leather and comes in two colors: black and natural. The fixing of the baskets, once folded, is done with small solid brass accessories: button studs.\xa0\r\nOur brand advocates a design "Made in France". Our workshop, which carries out everything from the cutting to the sewing of the baskets and their packaging, is located in the North-East of France. The accessories are ordered and engraved in a specialized workshop based in Paris. Only the veg-tan leather comes from a certified tannery located in Italy.\nThe Veg-Tan\xa0Leather\xa0(Vegetable-Tanned Leather)\r\n\n\nVegetable tanning is an ancient and traditional craft process that tanneries have passed down over the years, usually using wooden drums or tanning pits. Nowadays, tanneries are equipped with modern technologies and machinery, but the quality of the tanning still relies on one factor: time.Vegetable tanning is the most environmental-friendly way to tan leather, as there are no chemicals involved in this process: just natural ingredients, such as natural tannins, extracted from wood, bark, fruits or leaves. \xa0Only this technique is able to give leather such unique characteristics, retaining natural flaws and markings.\xa0This is why Quinoa chose veg-tan leather for its collection, mixing fashion and tradition, and comfort and style.\nThe Recycled Leather\xa0\n\n\nRecycled Leather (Bonded Leather) is mainly composed of real leather scraps bonded together with other natural ingredients.\xa0Its composition and the amount of genuine leather used may vary according to the manufacturer.\xa0The recycled leather used by Quinoa is made of 60% genuine leather, 20% natural latex, 10% natural oil and 10% organic dyes. All natural.\xa0Our recycled leather comes from a German factory, committed to conserving natural resources and protecting the environment. Through constant efforts, the factory is in perfect harmony with the strict German legislation regarding air and water pollution.It is an environmental-friendly alternative to genuine leather, as it reuses only scraps without extra farming. For all those reasons, Quinoa chose this material to design its little basket line.\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\nMeet the members of the family:\nMargot, Victor and Victor Junior are baskets that turn into tote bags once fitted with straps or handles. As baskets, they can be used as a magazine rack or \u201ccatch-all\u201d to store scarves, gloves, and all kinds of accessories\u2026\nNicolas is a "catchall", a small basket for pens, keys, etc.\nPierre-Elliott is a set of "catchall" small baskets fixed on a wooden wall peg.\nJuliette and Antoine, a clutch and a case, are to attach to the tote with a strap that fixes to the button stud accessory. They are quite useful for organizing your belongings inside the tote bag, or very stylish to wear individually.\n\nEdith is a small case that can hold a pen, a lip-gloss, or an electronic cigarette.\nArthur\xa0and\xa0Oscar\xa0are oversize baskets to store cushions, blankets... etc.\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\nMade in France. Our little family is entirely crafted in France. We attach great importance to this expertise that guarantees authenticity and quality, which comes at a price.\xa0\nEthics. The baskets are made of genuine calfskin veg-tan leather. We have chosen vegetable tannins in the transformation of hides into leather.\xa0This tanning process takes more time and is more expensive than the usual chemical ones, but it is far less polluting and less harmful.We remain environmentally conscious up to favoring packaging materials such as recycled paper and 100% organic cotton.\r\n\nQuality. We select fine, high-quality materials to provide you with outstanding products: full grain cowhide leather, solid brass, FSC-certified solid oak, gold hot foil stamping... and developed the manufacturing concept in the most sustainable way.\nUnique. Quinoa is more than just a line of baskets; it\u2019s a one-of-a-kind family. \r\n\r\nAll family members have the characteristics of being designed without seams or permanent accessories. This concept was thought out to make the baskets last longer than other traditional leather baskets.\r\n\r\nEach basket has its own name that humanizes it even more.\nICT Contribution. We have chosen to support \u201cInternational Childcare Trust\u201d because we believe it is right to foster an organization dedicated to the education and the health of children, the real actors of tomorrow.

We decided to join forces, combining our skills and experiences.\xa0After a busy period spent developing the concept, the first \xab Quinoa \xbb collection was born in December 2013, through our desire to design items that are easy to move, to store and most of all last in time.Our philosophy:\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\nQuinoa reflects an ethical conception, particularly through the choice of materials. Each family member is crafted with certified veg-tan or recycled leather and comes in two colors: black and natural. The fixing of the baskets, once folded, is done with small solid brass accessories: button studs.\xa0\r\nOur brand advocates a design "Made in France". Our workshop, which carries out everything from the cutting to the sewing of the baskets and their packaging, is located in the North-East of France. The accessories are ordered and engraved in a specialized workshop based in Paris. Only the veg-tan leather comes from a certified tannery located in Italy.\nThe Veg-Tan\xa0Leather\xa0(Vegetable-Tanned Leather)\r\n\n\nVegetable tanning is an ancient and traditional craft process that tanneries have passed down over the years, usually using wooden drums or tanning pits. Nowadays, tanneries are equipped with modern technologies and machinery, but the quality of the tanning still relies on one factor: time.Vegetable tanning is the most environmental-friendly way to tan leather, as there are no chemicals involved in this process: just natural ingredients, such as natural tannins, extracted from wood, bark, fruits or leaves. \xa0Only this technique is able to give leather such unique characteristics, retaining natural flaws and markings.\xa0This is why Quinoa chose veg-tan leather for its collection, mixing fashion and tradition, and comfort and style.\nThe Recycled Leather\xa0\n\n\nRecycled Leather (Bonded Leather) is mainly composed of real leather scraps bonded together with other natural ingredients.\xa0Its composition and the amount of genuine leather used may vary according to the manufacturer.\xa0The recycled leather used by Quinoa is made of 60% genuine leather, 20% natural latex, 10% natural oil and 10% organic dyes. All natural.\xa0Our recycled leather comes from a German factory, committed to conserving natural resources and protecting the environment. Through constant efforts, the factory is in perfect harmony with the strict German legislation regarding air and water pollution.It is an environmental-friendly alternative to genuine leather, as it reuses only scraps without extra farming. For all those reasons, Quinoa chose this material to design its little basket line.\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\nMeet the members of the family:\nMargot, Victor and Victor Junior are baskets that turn into tote bags once fitted with straps or handles. As baskets, they can be used as a magazine rack or \u201ccatch-all\u201d to store scarves, gloves, and all kinds of accessories\u2026\nNicolas is a "catchall", a small basket for pens, keys, etc.\nPierre-Elliott is a set of "catchall" small baskets fixed on a wooden wall peg.\nJuliette and Antoine, a clutch and a case, are to attach to the tote with a strap that fixes to the button stud accessory. They are quite useful for organizing your belongings inside the tote bag, or very stylish to wear individually.\n\nEdith is a small case that can hold a pen, a lip-gloss, or an electronic cigarette.\nArthur\xa0and\xa0Oscar\xa0are oversize baskets to store cushions, blankets... etc.\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\nMade in France. Our little family is entirely crafted in France. We attach great importance to this expertise that guarantees authenticity and quality, which comes at a price.\xa0\nEthics. The baskets are made of genuine calfskin veg-tan leather. We have chosen vegetable tannins in the transformation of hides into leather.\xa0This tanning process takes more time and is more expensive than the usual chemical ones, but it is far less polluting and less harmful.We remain environmentally conscious up to favoring packaging materials such as recycled paper and 100% organic cotton.\r\n\nQuality. We select fine, high-quality materials to provide you with outstanding products: full grain cowhide leather, solid brass, FSC-certified solid oak, gold hot foil stamping... and developed the manufacturing concept in the most sustainable way.\nUnique. Quinoa is more than just a line of baskets; it\u2019s a one-of-a-kind family. \r\n\r\nAll family members have the characteristics of being designed without seams or permanent accessories. This concept was thought out to make the baskets last longer than other traditional leather baskets.\r\n\r\nEach basket has its own name that humanizes it even more.\nICT Contribution. We have chosen to support \u201cInternational Childcare Trust\u201d because we believe it is right to foster an organization dedicated to the education and the health of children, the real actors of tomorrow.

Unknown to Michael, Abby has been in and out of detention for drug and theft and is now being threatened by her family that she is going to be sent away to boot camp. She is also dealing with her parents\u2019 divorce. It takes a lot of convincing, but Michael agrees to let Abby stay. After being within close courters, their differences become less of an anomaly and they become close. Michael sees a lot of himself in Abby and Abby can relate to Michael's pain and loneliness. Abby's Mother shows up at the house to find Abby, where Michael, who hasn't spoken to his daughter in over a year is forced to face her. Abby and Michael have been forever changed due to her stay. Now Michael is faced with the decision to either, let his family back in his life and try to move past his delusions of his dead wife or suffer in silence and go on living, comforted solely by his booze and delusions.\n"

u'\nRunner Oblivion is a game which the player uses parkour elements to get around, the game world will be unique, it will have landmarks from different countries such as the Empire State Building. The entire world will be at your will, each model will be specifically made so the player can climb, wall run and do parkour stunts. The game will also include a replay system allowing the player to share footage on youtube. Vehicles are also included in the game, which you may happily crash into the buildings. Buildings can fall down (you can still do parkour even if the buildings are destroyed) The game combines fast pace gameplay with strategic game play, this allows for quite interesting results.The game will have multiplayer (up to 20 players at the moment), it will offer loads of things to do including racing, team deathmatchs et cetera. The player will have numerous abilities including time control, physics control, focus (slo motion), jetpack and special powers which can alter everything such as building can be broken or one player uses their telekinesis to throw a cube at another player, the possibilities are endless.The funding will be put towards making the game more fluid and fun to play.\xa0\n'

u"\nHello and welcome to the kickstarter page for Runner Oblivion. To download a previous version of the game just go to IndieDB\xa0and if you like it vote yes on the steam greenlight page.\n\n\n\n\nIt all started a month ago. I had developed a tech demo and I decided to expand on it and eventually it became Runner Oblivion. The tech demo had the Brandenburg Gate as inspiration for a capture the landmark mode but the player was limited to just jumping. The 0.0.1 version introduced a obstacle course.\xa0The statue of liberty and a big city (not functional at the time) was added in the 0.0.1+ update. The 0.0.2 update was a big update it added destructable geometry, a expanded city (was all functional) and improved physics and shaders. Finally, the 0.0.2+ update added time powers and physics control for a object.The game is now being redeveloped from the top as I will explain later on.\n\n\nRunner Oblivion is a futuristic parkour game, which has the player use their super powers and parkour ablility to fight The Corporation. The Corporation are a terrorist group which has grasped control of New Boston and you have to stop them.The game is set in a futuristic haven full of genetically modified humans capable of matching your power. The player will need to rely on their fast reflexes and skill to uncover the sinister plans of The Corporation. New Boston is the capital of the world for it's leading technology and the eco friendly architecture.The multiplayer is a never ending war between The Corporation and The Runners.\n\n\nThe game was a tech demo in it's self but now It's a actual game. Since the 0.0.2+ version, I have been rebuilding the game to be a gritty experience which is graphically stunning and plays brilliantly. New Boston is completely different to the 'tech demo' and I am excited to unveil the city on the 1st of July.\xa0Currently it is not ready to show as key parts of the city are still missing but on the 1st, the first screenshots will come. The game needs funding in order to reach it's potential and that's where you lot come in.\xa0I've got a lot of work to do but I guarantee that it will be an amazing experience by the end of it.\xa0The money will provide me with the resources needed to create a AAA experience, the money will help me get good sound effects and improved servers caps.

u"\nAs one of\xa0the founders of Remedy Resolutions, I always wondered why more people didn't donate to charities. The conclusion\xa0we came to was convenience.

Through our app, we will make it possible for people to donate straight through their iTunes accounts on\xa0the app,\xa0instead of\xa0having to go through long credit card or mailing\xa0processes.

Current:
u'\nRemedy Resolutions was founded by five high-school students from around the United States. At a National Student Leadership Conference, we came together and decided that we wanted to make a difference in the world. Together, the five of us identified the problem we wanted to address: the gap between those that can donate and those that need charities\' funds. Our idea of an iTunes application that metaphorically "closes" this gap stems from this realization. Essentially, Remedy Resolutions is an app designed to make the process of donating easier. From global humanitarian organizations to local pet shelters, Remedy has plans to incorporate all types of charities in their convenience-oriented application. Instead of having to research individual charities and enter credit card information, Remedy Resolutions is a "one stop shop" for donations. However, advertising and developing the app itself is costly, so we felt as though Kickstarter would be an excellent solution to our financial challenges. We are committed to making this world better for future generations, but we cannot do it alone. In the words of Margaret Mead, "never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it\'s the only thing that ever has."

u"\nSTORYRunaways is a scripted, live action series \ninspired by time I spent traveling abroad after university. It's the story of six people who travel to Rio de Janeiro, seeking genuine adventure, but also to escape from or find solutions to problems back home.Thematically, Runaways is primarily about reinvention, and the fact that it\u2019s dishonest. It\u2019s what the characters want, but what they need is revelation. This is the story of how they find it. What\u2019s exciting is that they do it while discovering and then creating their own sphere within an exotic, new world (Rio).Here, we're funding episode 1 which features Julian, who after succumbing to tragedy at home, acts out by placing an offer on a house in Rio, sight unseen. He travels to Rio to see what might be. We also meet Ava, an Australian who has recently moved to Rio in search of a new start. Her first days are anything but ideal.Check out the web site for more detail on story, characters, and setting: http://www.createrunaways.com/\xa0\xa0Preview first few pages of current draft of script here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/rckyywjbc3u6fou/Pilot%20Preview.pdf\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0 GOALSFund the pilot. Find other people - who need their opportunity and who want to be a part of something - and start building. Along the journey, get discovered. If not, put the episode on YouTube or create our own platform. Soon, someone with power recognizes the series' lofty potential. It's fresh, and meaningful. The show that could. Get the distribution we deserve. Four episodes air next Spring. Slowly, it takes over. Another four air in the Fall. We break into culture. Keep going further.To submit info to join cast or crew and other needed positions: http://www.createrunaways.com/family/BREAKDOWNTo start, the goal of $26K will pay for 10 flights to Rio de Janeiro plus accommodation for three weeks in a great hostel (Olia Spa) at the end of the year. (Though, we'll shoot sooner if everything is ready). There's some extra cover included, plus some for your incentives. Finally, there's about 5K added to cover for fees from Kickstarter, Amazon, and taxes. Hate that, don't you? I understand, but still.I'll throw out a few more numbered goals for you:30K\xa0\xa0 Pays for food and Metro in Rio for all.35K\xa0\xa0 Pays cast and crew something extra for their time out of work and away from home.40K\xa0\xa0 It's selfish, I know, but I can quit working and focus full-time on assembling cast, crew, investors, and fans for six months.I could keep going a few more K, but every measure will be exhausted to recruit those who own equipment or have it borrowed, and to gain free access to locations.If you've got the power and are interested in the concept, match our funding goal for the ultimate reward. Call to find out: http://www.createrunaways.com/contact/\xa0 NOTES- I really can't convey how excited I am to finally pursue this. I believe the idea deserves the screen. It's a great story - fun, thrilling - that will resonate with many. What's more it showcases Rio, which if you haven't been, is magic. I appreciate your contributions and faith in the project.\xa0\xa0 \xa0 - For full disclosure, $500 of what we earn will go toward \nbuilding or providing something in a favela where we'll shoot. It's a great way to show thanks. I'd like the series to \nalways be involved in the community, so if there's any NGOs that want to\n partner up, please contact me. \n"

Bill Golderer, Founder and Convening Minister, Broad Street MinistryThe Case for Rooster Soup Company\xa0Rooster Soup Company is a joint venture of Federal Donuts, Philadelphia\u2019s homegrown fried chicken-and-donut shop, and Broad Street Ministry, a broad-minded faith community providing social services and meals to vulnerable Philadelphians.\xa0Rooster Soup Company intends to open a gourmet soup restaurant in Philadelphia. Using chicken backs and bones from Federal Donuts, we can make delicious, inventive soups. The capital raised through Kickstarter will be used to lease, fit out and staff a location for Rooster Soup Company.What if people knew, that simply by buying lunch, they would be helping to improve the life of a Philadelphian in need? The profit on a single bowl of soup is roughly equal to the cost of one meal and social services for a guest at Broad Street Hospitality Collaborative.\xa0All of the profits generated from selling tasty soups to the general public will flow directly to Broad Street Hospitality Collaborative. This year, they will serve more than 60,000 meals alongside essential social services to 3,500 unique people.\xa0\nBroad Street Hospitality Collaborative offers a mailing address to over 1,850 Philadelphians in need of a connection to society and a place to receive identification; essential personal care items from razors to toothbrushes to 5,000 pairs of underwear and 6,500 pairs of socks in 2013; almost 4,000 changes of clothes and 1,200 mended garments a year; legal representation; therapeutic arts; and access to medical and behavioral health nurses.\xa0Rooster Soup Company will turn useful scraps into a sustainable annuity that supports Broad Street Ministry\u2019s vision of providing radical hospitality and meals to the Philadelphians most in need.\xa0\n\n\nASSETS\xa0Rooster Soup Company has a constant, free or low-cost source of stock: Federal Donuts currently discards enough chicken bones to produce about 2,000 bowls of chicken soup each week.\xa0Rooster Soup Company won\u2019t serve just any chicken soup. This soup will be made from free-roaming, antibiotic-free, air-chilled birds that are raised on a 100% vegetable, GMO-free diet. This chicken soup will be made by people who know chicken.\xa0Rooster Soup Company projections call for annual revenues in excess of $500,000, with net profits of $50,000 annually, growing to $100,000 as the business matures. This represents a return on capital of more than 20% a year. Our projections are based on over ten years of experience opening and operating restaurants, including similar operating models in Philadelphia.\xa0Rooster Soup Company is an opportunity to pilot a social venture in a city that has always innovated around food and fun.\xa0Rooster Soup Company will fill a hole in the lunchtime market where the greatest soup you\u2019ve ever had belongs. The bones and backs from our uncaged, air-chilled, antibiotic-free birds make a superior, nutritious chicken stock that can be the base for a multitude of delicious soups. Rooster Soup Company is unique, creative collaboration between a nonprofit organization and a for-profit business.\xa0Rooster Soup Company is a chance to create a sustainable revenue stream for a nonprofit that makes a difference in the Philadelphia community, as opposed to making a one-time donation.\xa0\n\nA group of volunteers ready to serve lunch at Broad Street.\n\n\nRev.

Current:
u'\nIn Philadelphia there is a place \u2013 five places, actually \u2013 where you can get the best fried chicken and donuts of your life at the same time.\xa0It\u2019s called Federal Donuts, and all we do is make donuts, fried chicken and coffee.Because we buy whole chickens, we have backs and bones we can\u2019t use, and have to pay to have them taken away and disposed of \u2013 about 1,000 lbs of chicken per week, in fact, from the highest quality, air-chilled chickens, that are raised on an all-vegetable diet without antibiotics.Stuffing a landfill with 1,000 pounds of nutrition every single week is not only absurd, it\'s twice as ridiculous when people are going hungry here in Philadelphia.At first, we thought we would make soup to feed hungry people. We soon found out there was an opportunity to make an even bigger impact by forging a more powerful partnership.Philadelphia is the poorest large city and the hungriest Congressional District in America.  If all you want is a meal, there are ample places to get fed.  But there\u2019s only one place where those Philadelphians experiencing hunger, homelessness, and poverty are served a meal, can receive essential services, and feel part of a community.Every week, 1,200 people come to  Broad Street Hospitality Collaborative\xa0to eat a healthy and delicious meal (prepared by an Executive Chef and served tableside by volunteer waitstaff), to check their mail, or to get a change of clothes.Most importantly, vulnerable Philadelphians come to Broad Street Ministry\u2019s Hospitality Collaborative to feel at home.But the demand at Broad Street\u2019s Hospitality Collaborative grows every day and what Broad Street Ministry truly need more than anything else is money.That\'s when we realized: Turning delicious chicken into money is something we\'re good at.We want to turn our practically free chicken stock into tasty soups that you can buy. And we\'ll donate 100% of the profit from every bowl to Broad Street\u2019s Hospitality Collaborative.Based on our 10 years experience in the restaurant industry, we forecast annual profits at Rooster Soup Co. of $50,000 the first year, growing to $100,000 annually after five years. Even just the first year\'s $50,000 in profit can supply 24,272 meals to needy guests.That\'s why we\'re asking for your help to open the Rooster Soup Company, and turn this into a reality.Better than a one-time gift\u2026Instead of a one-time donation, your Kickstarter dollars will help us build a perpetual money machine: Nearly-free chicken stock in, jobs and donations out. You\'ll help us create a model of monetary giving free of the extra work required for grants and traditional donor models. Does that sound unusual? That\'s because it is! We\'re veterans of the hospitality industry - at every price point.  We can make it work with your help. Below, you\'ll find detailed information on how our profit donations will deliver for those in need, who our giving partner is, what your Kickstarter backing is needed for, and how else you can help. In short, though:We want to use high-quality chicken backs & bones that would go to waste\u2026\xa0\u2026 to make delicious soup to sell\xa0\u2026 and donate 100% of our profits to a local organization dedicated to helping those in needAnd we can\'t do this without your help. That\'s why we\'re Kickstarting the startup capital needed to set up the restaurant, in order to start serving up soup & generating revenue for Broad Street Hospital Collaborative.Please join us in giving a sustainable hand up to vulnerable Philadelphians.Why Federal Donuts and the Broad Street Hospitality Collaborative joined forcesThe Broad Street Ministry Hospitality Collaborative offers four meals per week, serving approximately 1,200 Philadelphians experiencing hunger, homelessness, and poverty.  This year, Broad Street\u2019s chef will prepare over 60,000 individual platings.  Broad Street distributes personal care items like underwear, socks, deodorant, and soap in a way that affirms the dignity of its guests, over 43,000 such items last year.  And Broad Street serves as the mailing address for over 1,750 people in need of a home base.  In addition to receiving correspondence with loved ones and prescription medication through the mail service, having a mailing address is the first step to getting an identification card or a job.  The Broad Street mail service handled over 52,000 pieces of mail in 2013.Those are the nuts and bolts.  More broadly, the Hospitality Collaborative is committed to bringing healing through hospitality.  The Hospitality Collaborative uses a cutting edge trauma-informed, harm-reduction model, combining best practices from a wide variety of fields and emphasizing a sense that there is always enough for everyone.  How does it work?First, trauma-informed means that the staff and volunteers at Broad Street assume that everyone who comes through the doors has undergone trauma due to hunger, homelessness, or poverty.  It means that the Hospitality Collaborative does everything possible to reduce anxiety and not trigger a trauma response.For example, no guest at Broad Street ever stands in a line.  When most of us stand in line, we trust that we\u2019ll get what we\u2019re waiting for when we get to the front of the line.  But for Broad Street\u2019s guests, the experience is often a long time waiting\u2026 for nothing.So guests of Broad Street choose where they\u2019d like to sit at round tables with centerpieces and tablecloths.  And then volunteers come and bring them a beautifully plated, delicious and nutritious meal on real china with metal forks and knives.  Most importantly, no one waited in line for it.Second, harm-reduction means that we assume Broad Street is the safest place for our guests to be.  Many guests of Broad Street struggle with mental illness and are sometimes talking to people we can\u2019t see or saying things that many of us would find scary or unsettling.  Broad Street commits to getting to know these guests, focusing mostly on making sure they feel safe and comfortable.Broad Street is committed to making sure that guests, especially those in distress or struggling with a mental illness or addiction, know they are safe at the Hospitality Collaborative.  They don\u2019t need to leave or rush through their meals.  Broad Street doesn\u2019t have any metal detectors and doesn\u2019t employ any uniformed security - and hasn\u2019t had to call law enforcement in over four years.The bottom line is that Broad Street Ministry is not a soup kitchen, it\u2019s a household.  The trauma-informed, harm-reduction model demonstrates our commitment to radical hospitality, the dignity of every person, and the long-term flourishing of our guests.With your help, we can create a perpetual revenue stream to keep the Hospitality Collaborative strong in the face of ever-increasing need. The Rooster Soup Company\u2019s innovative profit-non-profit model will help Broad Street scale\r\n \r\nIn 2013, Broad Street Hospitality Collaborative served 51,700 meals to 3,500 individual people, up from 23,600 meals in 2012. Need is increasing at an incredible pace. At the same time need is growing, state and federal funding is shrinking -- creative, collaborative funding sources are more necessary than ever. With your help, and Rooster Soup Company\'s projected first year profits, we can supply 24,272 meals to vulnerable guests. That will go a long way towards helping Broad Street serve everyone who needs it. And with your help, and hard work, and luck, we can grow that profit every year to help Broad Street help the increasing number of people vulnerable to economic upheaval.Okay, how can I help? What will my Kickstarter money buy?\xa0Our goal of $150,000 sounds like a lot of money, but it\u2019s actually not enough to open a restaurant like Rooster Soup Co. \r\nThankfully, we have a few heavy-hitter donors who are willing to donate an additional $100,000 to complete our startup capital\u2026 if we can fully fund this Kickstarter to prove the Philadelphia community will support us.\xa0That\'s why we truly need your help. We cannot do this without you.\xa0Here\'s exactly how your money will be used\xa0If we are fully funded, we\'ll receive our private donor match, and allocate our $250,000 in total startup capital as follows:\xa0$125,000 will go to renovate our retail location for Rooster Soup Co.\xa0$90,000 in furniture, fixture and equipment \u2013 most of that number is kitchen equipment.\xa0$2,000 in licenses and permits.\xa0$15,000 in professional fees to a lawyer, architect and accountant.\xa0$5,000 in opening food inventory.\xa0$13,000 working capital and pre-opening expenses: training staff, buying business cards, electricity bills and everything else.\xa0We\'ve done this before; we\'ve run the numbers, and we\'re doing things as lean as we reasonably can.\xa0You might wonder why certain things cost so much \u2014 a very reasonable question!\xa0We need to ensure that the restaurant can turn out enough soup to turn a profit, and of course become a place customers will want to visit and revisit. \r\nOur experience has proven that spending less may put a ceiling on our potential, especially if it impacts our production capacity, or our ability to attract & retain customers. That would make it much harder to meet our profit goals.\xa0Our goal is not just to open a restaurant, but to earn a net profit of $50,000+ per year, based on our projections, plus create ten full-time jobs for local people.\xa0In just over three years, Rooster Soup Company\'s charitable giving will eclipse its startup capital\u2026 and continue to do so for many years.\xa0Think of Rooster Soup Company as an investment annuity for our neighbors in need.\r\nWe can generate a higher profit for a good cause\r\nWith dramatically reduced food and kitchen costs because of our free source of chicken stock, Rooster Soup Co. projects a profit margin of 20%, a vast improvement over the standard restaurant profit margin of 12%.\xa0What we\'re personally contributing\xa0Opening and operating a successful restaurant is incredibly difficult and time-consuming, requiring thousands of hours of up-front planning, development and implementation.\xa0The principals of Federal Donuts and Broad Street Hospitality Collaborative are contributing our time and expertise at no cost to Rooster Soup Company.\xa0Post-opening, the principals will continue to provide management, oversight, strategy and marketing services to Rooster Soup Company at no cost.\xa0Federal Donuts is also contributing the primary ingredient of Rooster Soup Company, chicken stock, practically for free. This ongoing contribution will create significantly enhanced profit margins, effectively creating a multiplier effect on the amount of money Rooster Soup Company is able to contribute to the Broad Street Hospitality Collaborative.\xa0We\'re the best people to start & run this innovative profit/non-profit model.We have the ingredients for soup and we know how to set up and run a successful, sustainable, profitable restaurant. If anyone can make this work, and continue working for years and years, it\'s us.\xa0Not to toot our own horns, but\u2026\r\nSteve Cook and Mike Solomonov of CookNSolo have over 10 years\u2019 experience opening and operating restaurants in Philadelphia, including Zahav, Percy Street Barbecue, and Federal Donuts.\xa0Federal Donuts has been critically acclaimed in the press by The New York Times, Saveur, Bon Appetit, and USA Today, and has appeared on national televisions shows\xa0The Chew, Unique Sweets, BrewDogs, 1st Look, VH1 Big Morning Buzz, and has an upcoming July 2, 2014 appearance on Good Morning America.\xa0Our restaurant Zahav is one of only five restaurants currently ranked Four Bells: Superior, Philadelphia Inquirer critic Craig LaBan\u2019s highest designation. Mike and Steve were named "Empire Builders," in 2012 by Food & Wine magazine.\xa0In 2011, Mike Solomonov won the James Beard Foundation Award for Best Chef: MidAtlantic, which is like winning an Oscar for your food.\xa0Broad Street Ministry\u2019s no slouch either.  The Hospitality Collaborative\u2019s unique approach to serving those in need has been covered by the Philadelphia Inquirer, Daily News and City Paper, as well as the Huffington Post.\xa0In addition to the Hospitality Collaborative, Broad Street Ministry has a robust residential worshiping community that meets every Sunday and is committed to being a progressive religious voice.\xa0We love Federal Donuts but Broad Street Ministry is no stranger to unlikely hospitality partnerships.\xa0Broad Street Ministry has been recognized for the exemplary way it uses its 114-year old neo-Gothic building.\xa0Broad Street Ministry Founder and Convening Minister Rev. Bill Golderer is a 2014 recipient of the Steppy Homelessness Advocacy Award.\xa0Prior to founding Broad Street Ministry, Bill was the founding Director of the Center for Church Life at Auburn Theological Seminary in New York City.  Before that, he worked as a pastor in Chicago and in electoral politics in Washington DC.\xa0Read more about Bill here.\xa0And if you want to see Bill on tv, he appears in the current season of The Bible Rules, on H2.\xa0Our legal structure reflects our mission\xa0Rooster Soup Company will be an independent entity jointly controlled by Federal Donuts and Broad Street Ministry. We won\u2019t be a legally designated as a 501c3 non-profit because Rooster will not be directly performing charitable work, but instead will create a revenue stream for Broad Street Hospitality Collaborative.\xa0Joint ownership is important to us; this is not some super-secret profit-making venture.  100% of our net profits will go to Broad Street Hospitality Collaborative, which will be clearly spelled out in our operating agreement, along with all other corporate governance issues. Although the operating agreement does not exist yet, we anticipate that each party (Federal and Broad Street) will have negative control over material changes to operations, assets, etc. Specifically, no changes could be made to the provisions governing profit distributions without everyone\u2019s consent.Net profits basically means whatever is leftover after we pay all of our expenses (food, labor, rent, utlities, etc.).  This will all be calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles and reviewed by an independent accountant. Neither Federal Donuts nor CookNSolo nor anyone else involved will charge a management fee to Rooster, other than any person who may be directly employed as a manager at Rooster Soup.  We do not believe there is any tax benefit available to Federal Donuts from its relationship with Rooster Soup Company. \r\n \r\nFederal Donuts will contribute the primary ingredient (chicken backs and bones) of the soup to Rooster Soup at no cost, period.  While it is our intention to make the soup itself (or at least the chicken soup base) as low cost as possible, we also realize that there are ancillary costs associated with turning chicken bones into soup, including vegetables, utilities, labor and transportation.  If these hard costs rise to a level that materially impacts our Federal Donuts business, we will look to recoup these costs. In any event, Rooster\'s food cost will be significantly lower than if it did not have this free source of chicken bones.\r\n \r\nThe #1 priority of Rooster Soup is to make as much money for Broad Street Ministry as possible.\xa0You\'ve made it all the way down here\u2026Please, would you help us use what would be thrown away to create jobs and sustainably fund hospitality for our neighbors in need?Even $20 will help us get that much closer to fully funded\u2026 and the matching donations from our private donors.\n\nA group of volunteers ready to serve lunch at Broad Street.\n\n\nRev.

You can purchase Choice or Prime sub primal cuts from your favorite butcher for say $10.00 to $14.00 per pound. Savings of at least 50%\xa0\n\n\nIn the past, you were not able to professionally and safely dry age your own steaks. Until NOW, we bring a \xa0brand new perspective to\xa0your home (or even small commercial property) grilling with the best dry aged steaks completely under your control.\xa0Now the joy of grilling your own dry age steaks is a reality with this truly unique home dry age steaklocker.\nThat's how easy it is...\nStep one: \xa0buy your favorite sub primal cut from your favorite butcher. Best results are assured with bone-in sub primal like Ribeye and Sirloin or a combination of those two.\n\n\nStep two: place it in the fridge.\nThat's it. Let it rest (dry age) for at least 21 days or longer depending on your desired flavor profile, then cut yourself your own individual steaks.\n\n\nMODERN TECHNOLOGY PAIRED WITH OLD WORLD TECHNIQUES\nSteaklocker's first production line run is offered in a standard 34 inch cabinet size.\n\n\nSteaklocker is developing \xa0a state of the art digital hygrometer controller (patent pending)\xa0allowing you to adjust the recommended settings to vary the flavor and tenderness of the meat.\xa0\nWe are developing our own smart phone app (IOS & if stretch goal achieved, Android) specifically for the dry age fridge. The primary application is the real-time digital sensor and controller (patent pending)\xa0that provides you with instant feedback on the critical temperature\xa0and humidity operations of the fridge. Until now, only the absolute high end humidors and fridges were able to control humidity inside the fridge. This equipment would cost anything from $ 5,000 up. Our (patent pending) modular digital\xa0hygrometer controller will use modern I-technology to achieve this.\n\nIMP Sensor Schematic\n\nThis sensor is bluetooth enabled and once linked up through the IMP sensor system, integrates seamlessly into Steaklocker's own smart app. This allows you to\xa0connect in seconds using just your smartphone.\xa0\n\n\nThis feature will alert your smart-phone when preset values are exceeded. This nifty element will ensure you won't loose your dry age product investment if power failures or other emergencies occur.\n\nSteaklocker Smart App (IOS)\n\nAdditional smart app features such as provenance information, complete step by step dry aging operational instructions, nutritional and caloric information for major recipes, top 100 dry age beef supplying farms\xa0and\xa0top 100 best steakhouses\xa0will all be available to ensure you have the very best Steaklocker experience. A 1-800 rapid customer service help number will also be provided.\nSOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT KIT (SDK)\nSteaklocker's smart app is planning to be as open as possible. It generates streams of data that can be used or stored and applied in many different ways. We will develop more connected speciality refrigeration and other devices for niche markets. In order to take advantage of the talent out in the market, we want to enable suitably interested people to develop software and hardware solutions that will work with as many\xa0device\xa0as possible. We're hoping to create an ecosystem of connected useful and practical culinary devices - that's why we\u2019re making our SDK available to dedicated parties.\n\nSteaklocker SmartApp (IOS)\n\nNew development option such as a live optic feed, sensor driven grilling thermometers and many other features are in development and are estimated for release in future months.\nOther Design Features\nWe have designed our dry age fridge based on our commercial success with steakhouse dry age environments. We have designed a unique modular hygrometer controller (patent pending) that is completely independent of the internal display sensor to ensure that internal humidity is achieved at optimal levels. Another first in dry aging technology.\n\nLatest Modular Humidity Controller\n\nSteaklocker has other optional features such as Himalayan Salt Blocks and\xa0Special Herb and Spice Silk Pouches that deliver additional flavor, taste and intensify the natural beef aroma.\xa0\n\n250m years in the making - Himalyan Salt Blocks\n\nBeautiful designs includes a sleek UV resistant stainless steel, UV protected tempered glass door and modern luxurious chrome handle bars.\xa0\n\n\nThe inside is enveloped with food grade black embossed aluminum with 2 removable extending chrome shelves for the dry age product. Hanging the cuts from the upper shelf is also possible with this design.\n\n\nSteaklocker's aesthetics are designed to co-ordinate with all of your other appliances or can be installed as an eye catching display case in your kitchen or courtyard BBQ area.\n\n\nTechnical Specifications:\n750 BTU powerful compressor\nFan Forced air flow\nPrecise Temperature range - 33F to 68F\nSmart Application Sensor Control - Bluetooth enabled\nFiberglass/Metal exterior with embossed black aluminum interior\n2 pane glass UV protected stainless steel door\nDigital temperature and humidity display\nActive carbon odor filter (replaceable)\nStandard Cabinet Size\n2 full extension adjustable and removable chrome wire shelves\n65 lbs. dry aging product capacity\nInterior germicidal sterilization lamps\nSelf closing door with lock\n37dba sound rating\nWhat is Dry Aging\nDry aging does for red meat what cave aging does for cheese or cellaring for Bordeaux \u2013 it\xa0improves the taste greatly with time. In addition, it will tenderize the meat after approximately 18 - 21 days depending on the animal.\n\nFIRST DAY RIBEYE\n\nThe short story is this : Dry aging meat is the traditional way of creating superbly tender meat by letting naturally occurring enzymes slowly tenderize the meat. \xa0\n\n12 Day Ribeye\n\nAssuming the right conditions, it takes between 16 to 21 days for the process to come to fruition. After 21 days, the meat will not get more tender but will with additional time, anything to 70+ days, become more flavorful.\xa0\n\n21 Day Ribeye\n\nGenerally, the longer it ages past 21 days, the more it develops flavor to a more nutty taste. Naturally, it all depends on the type of animal, type of muscle you dry aging, USDA grade, the size of the cut, age and prior welfare of the animal.\xa0\n\n45 DAY RIBEYE\n\nDry aging meat is almost always done in sub primal cuts of meat due to the better yield and tenderness as well as flavor. Sub primal cuts are section of beef that are left on the bone and have the majority of their fat covers still intact.\xa0\n\n\nThis is important as you want this protection over the muscle tissue as over time the controlled air cooled environment will remove moisture from the cut. It also plays a role in the type of cuts you choose. They are generally limited to the rib, short loin and sirloin sub primal cuts.\xa0\nThe reason to leave the bones on the meat is that when it continues to go through the dry aging process it will pull away from the bone. If there are no bones, the \u201cpulling\u201d will result in higher non usable product. It also has the strongest nutty flavor near the bone.\nSAFETY CAUTION\nSome people dry age steaks inside their regular fridge. This is not recommended (in fact, it is illegal in a commercial environment) as the environment in your fridge is not suitable for dry aging. Even popular dry bag short term dry aging can be dangerous. In the main this is due to the high humidity and highly fluctuating temperature in your household fridge that promotes bacterial growth which in turn can cause foodbourne illnesses and ruin your meat. In addition to high humidity, it lacks a germicidal inhibitor such a Spectrum UVC lamp.\xa0\n\nUVC Bacterial Light in Steaklocker Fridge\n\nThese lamps are vital to kill bacteria that are present on the meat and inside the fridge. In fact, every feature of our Steaklocker, such as the continuous\xa0fan forced air flow\xa0and constant low temperature are critical to the safe dry aging process. Other devices such as dry aging bags, that promote \xa0short term dry aging, are not safe due to the lack of the above mentioned features. You should not gamble with ecoli and other bacterial based food bourne illnesses.\n__________________________________________________________________\nSo, this is very important, do not put your own safety or that of your friends or family at risk. \xa0\n__________________________________________________________________\n\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0THE TEAM\xa0\n\n\n\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0AN INSPIRATION OF STEAKLOVERS\nIt all started In 2010, Nadia Bruno was the Marketing Manager of the team that built the first steakhouse in the midwest featuring an integrated dry age steak glass display fridge.\xa0Guests were greeted by a rare, artful glimpse into the beef aging process uniquely showcased upon entrance in a dry aged cooling room lined with Himalyan salt blocks intended to intensify beef flavors.\n\nOur most admired midwest steakhouse\n\nIntegrating the display fridge into the overall design of the restaurant was as a novel way to bring the pride of the chefs visually closer to the guests.

You can purchase Choice or Prime sub primal cuts from your favorite butcher for say $10.00 to $14.00 per pound. Savings of at least 50%\xa0\n\n\nIn the past, you were not able to professionally and safely dry age your own steaks. Until NOW, we bring a \xa0brand new perspective to\xa0your home (or even small commercial property) grilling with the best dry aged steaks completely under your control.\xa0Now the joy of grilling your own dry age steaks is a reality with this truly unique home dry age steaklocker.\nThat's how easy it is...\nStep one: \xa0buy your favorite sub primal cut from your favorite butcher. Best results are assured with bone-in sub primal like Ribeye and Sirloin or a combination of those two.\n\n\nStep two: place it in the fridge.\nThat's it. Let it rest (dry age) for at least 21 days or longer depending on your desired flavor profile, then cut yourself your own individual steaks.\n\n\nMODERN TECHNOLOGY PAIRED WITH OLD WORLD TECHNIQUES\nSteaklocker's first production line run is offered in a standard 34 inch cabinet size.\n\n\nSteaklocker is developing \xa0a state of the art digital hygrometer controller (patent pending)\xa0allowing you to adjust the recommended settings to vary the flavor and tenderness of the meat.\xa0\nWe are developing our own smart phone app (IOS & if stretch goal achieved, Android) specifically for the dry age fridge. The primary application is the real-time digital sensor and controller (patent pending)\xa0that provides you with instant feedback on the critical temperature\xa0and humidity operations of the fridge. Until now, only the absolute high end humidors and fridges were able to control humidity inside the fridge. This equipment would cost anything from $ 5,000 up. Our (patent pending) modular digital\xa0hygrometer controller will use modern I-technology to achieve this.\n\nIMP Sensor Schematic\n\nThis sensor is bluetooth enabled and once linked up through the IMP sensor system, integrates seamlessly into Steaklocker's own smart app. This allows you to\xa0connect in seconds using just your smartphone.\xa0\n\n\nThis feature will alert your smart-phone when preset values are exceeded. This nifty element will ensure you won't loose your dry age product investment if power failures or other emergencies occur.\n\nSteaklocker Smart App (IOS)\n\nAdditional smart app features such as provenance information, complete step by step dry aging operational instructions, nutritional and caloric information for major recipes, top 100 dry age beef supplying farms\xa0and\xa0top 100 best steakhouses\xa0will all be available to ensure you have the very best Steaklocker experience. A 1-800 rapid customer service help number will also be provided.\nSOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT KIT (SDK)\nSteaklocker's smart app is planning to be as open as possible. It generates streams of data that can be used or stored and applied in many different ways. We will develop more connected speciality refrigeration and other devices for niche markets. In order to take advantage of the talent out in the market, we want to enable suitably interested people to develop software and hardware solutions that will work with as many\xa0device\xa0as possible. We're hoping to create an ecosystem of connected useful and practical culinary devices - that's why we\u2019re making our SDK available to dedicated parties.\n\nSteaklocker SmartApp (IOS)\n\nNew development option such as a live optic feed, sensor driven grilling thermometers and many other features are in development and are estimated for release in future months.\nOther Design Features\nWe have designed our dry age fridge based on our commercial success with steakhouse dry age environments. We have designed a unique modular hygrometer controller (patent pending) that is completely independent of the internal display sensor to ensure that internal humidity is achieved at optimal levels. Another first in dry aging technology.\n\nLatest Modular Humidity Controller\n\nSteaklocker has other optional features such as Himalayan Salt Blocks and\xa0Special Herb and Spice Silk Pouches that deliver additional flavor, taste and intensify the natural beef aroma.\xa0\n\n250m years in the making - Himalyan Salt Blocks\n\nBeautiful designs includes a sleek UV resistant stainless steel, UV protected tempered glass door and modern luxurious chrome handle bars.\xa0\n\n\nThe inside is enveloped with food grade black embossed aluminum with 2 removable extending chrome shelves for the dry age product. Hanging the cuts from the upper shelf is also possible with this design.\n\n\nSteaklocker's aesthetics are designed to co-ordinate with all of your other appliances or can be installed as an eye catching display case in your kitchen or courtyard BBQ area.\n\n\nTechnical Specifications:\n750 BTU powerful compressor\nFan Forced air flow\nPrecise Temperature range - 33F to 68F\nSmart Application Sensor Control - Bluetooth enabled\nFiberglass/Metal exterior with embossed black aluminum interior\n2 pane glass UV protected stainless steel door\nDigital temperature and humidity display\nActive carbon odor filter (replaceable)\nStandard Cabinet Size\n2 full extension adjustable and removable chrome wire shelves\n65 lbs. dry aging product capacity\nInterior germicidal sterilization lamps\nSelf closing door with lock\n37dba sound rating\nWhat is Dry Aging\nDry aging does for red meat what cave aging does for cheese or cellaring for Bordeaux \u2013 it\xa0improves the taste greatly with time.

Until they closed to 7 PM, he still home because he need to clean his room first. But  My brother house is 5 mins far away to go to my workplace. Have a bad investor partner, I made my logo done. I told my investor guy pay the trademark bill online. He said let his friend do it, because she is working at law firm. My investor partner said it faster get done. It's only $50 lawyer fee. few weeks later she tell me, he didn't paid for it. Ask me to pay for it and tell to me $800 for trademark brand name. If I want do image logo of brand then it's other $800. She let me give money to her or him either one. Because she paid it already. By that night I gave $800 to my investor partner. Few month later I ask her about it, she said I didn't pay for it.  Because my good investor partner hide money away. They gave me too much wrong price. The correct quote $275 for trademark fee and $50 lawyer fee. However it won't be $800.I give them 66% stake each person total 200% and I asked them very clean. If they don't want to working together, please tell me and quit. Answers is they won't quit. But they were more mistake until we rupture.Thank you for everyone read my story.The tee shirts have to be good printing and it need more than 2 different of printing then it will be great.

Firstly, it's really important that this car is taken back to its homeland and the people of America get to see it again. \xa0Secondly, it's simply going to be an amazing trip to observe; the man who undertook the trip in 1902, Oliver Lippincott, was full of spirit and decided to forge this trail despite the odds. \xa0We love that sense of adventure and Nick and his brother have that same gung-ho attitude. \xa0Failure is not an option for them. \xa0 It will be a documentary that's got lovely character, a fascinating historical theme, human interaction and emotion.With the money raised we're going to fund Nick and Chris's trip which involves getting the car to the US and the support that will be necessary to fulfil the challenge. \xa0We will send a full production crew and will make a broadcast-ready one-hour long documentary. \xa0Before the official launch of the programme, all funders will get a premiere viewing online.\n"

All funds\xa0received\xa0will go towards the\xa0technology that we need to create games.

I was 75% done with the coding by the time Kickstarter and Amazon got together and approved us, so over the last few days I finished it and submitted it to PlayStation Mobile today. 17 October 2014.Lastly- We have some great ideas in the works (at least we think they are great) On 19 October 2014 I will begin coding our next game so it is a great time to jump\xa0aboard\xa0and give us a helping hand. We have some great rewards for those that do. Even if you can not help out financially please help by spreading the word about Vanguard Chaos Gaming.

u'\nSlurp Bar is an exciting new bar which will be located in the new developing area of Downtown San Antonio, Texas bringing all the original flavors of Liquors, Bottled and Draft Beers, and Wines; plus our own Handcrafted Beers and Liquors.I love the taste of beer and trying different mixtures of liquors which has lead me in attempting to create my own flavors of Liquors and Beers all Handcrafted at home. My goal with Slurp Bar is to open one of the first bars in San Antonio that crafts and sells its handcrafted Liquors and Beers to its customers.Along with our handcrafted Liquors and Beers we will also sell all of the originals Bud, Dos XX, Heineken, Johnnie Walker, Malibu, Vodka, and so on come on we are a bar so expect the normal and the un-normal; all of our beers will be served in bottle or draft its up to you.To begin I would love to have my bar open in the LGBT area of San Antonio, Texas but unfortunately due to issues with Business/Community Associations restrictions have been placed to not allow a business with the intent to sell alcohol is allowed in the area. So I have looked elsewhere which has lead us to Broadway in the new developing area of the Pearl Brewery with new apartments, coffee shops, goods store, cafes and other business moving and opening we believe our new bar will make a perfect match for the area.The new area which we have chosen is a great area, its only steps away from the famous and newly constructed San Antonio River, you have Hotels, Condos, and Apartment around, above, and down the street from us. Join us and take a stroll visit some of the new great shops, and other business in the area on your way down.The only thing standing in the way of me being able to successfully open my bar of my dreams is funding for the lease on the property, furniture, inventory, permit for the sell and production of alcohol.By funding my project you will be helping me head towards the completion of my lifelong dream, as a thank you for all the help you have provided we will be sending out gifts of all sizes for your contribution as mentioned in the Pledge.We thank you for all your support, if you cant send funds today its ok just referrer us to some of your friends who might be able to help us out.

u"\nDesserts are something we all enjoyed as children. Something sweet and special for us to enjoy at parties or holidays. My dream is to bring that feeling back for adults by making those same delicious desserts, only with liquor!\xa0I have currently developed over 40 recipes of made-from-scratch cakes with liquor. This is a passion I can't seem to shake, so I am embracing it and pursuing a goal to open a mobile adult dessert factory. I also believe that the best foods are made from scratch, fresh, and with the best ingredients. My promise to my customers is a great product at an affordable price that they won't have to share with the kids.\xa0I have already met with a commercial kitchen to contract with and have developed a list of steps to become operational by the end of 2014. While most of the licensing and permits required to operate a food business like this one aren't super expensive, I have already reached my limit for personal investment funds. I still need to purchase business insurance, secure a lawyer, and purchase supplies and equipment to begin production.\xa0My business plan starts with production. In order to convince lenders that my product is viable, I need to figure out my costs, establish pricing, host taste testing events for product development, and promote my future business at local events. All of these things cost money! To be honest, it is going to cost a lot more than my $3,000 goal, but you have to start somewhere. So there it is. My dream. The first step. Now, it's up to you to help make this project a reality. Every dollar helps!\xa0\n"

u"\nHello and I'm so ecstatic you are here reading My story. I am a 34 yr. old mother too a beautiful 14 year old daughter. I have came too this website after hearing about it because of My Dream. I have lived with Type 1 Diabetes \xa0for the past 24 years of my life now; having undergone 2 Pancreas transplants, many other complications associated with the diabetes, and as of 1 year ago was put on Hemodialysis permanently. However, despite not being able to work a regular job, it doesnt mean i do not want more out of my \xa0life than to sit home, be sick, and do nothing! \xa0So thats where my dream comes in...I love all things crafts! But the main things I do are: Jewelry, Knitting & Crocheting ( anything & everything ), and Sewing / Quilting. To better provide for my daughter, I want too be able to start my own small business. I already sell alot of items, but really want to go bigger with it! My favorite things to sew/quilt, etc., are quilts and matching pillows for all but mainly kids, and teddy bears too match. I also have a passion for making these and other such things too donate to children at hospitals such as St. Jude's or The Childrens Hospital of Chicago and others whom are battling illness. I began doing this due to losing my first born daughter tooHypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome at just 15 days old. The hospital had volunteers coming too all the rooms with donated items to give to the children in the intensive care heart unit. And what a better way to Pay It Forward than to donate back! \xa0I love to bring smiles especially to an innocent child. With your help, I can not only make my dream of being able too, \xa0but also wanting to make these things for children who suffer everyday from illness. As well as build up my business at the same time. I would love to be able to make enough to not only donate them to local area hospitals, but nationwide as well. Please help both myself and my daughter too be able to start this business but also to be able to make more too donate more! I will also be uploading a video very soon!\n"
Current:
u'\nSo this is my story in a much shorter rundown...I was introduced to the awesome world of crafts at age of 7 by one of \xa0my crafty favorite aunts; crocheting, knitting, beadwork, and sewing to name my faves. I stuck with it and eventually began selling my work here and there. This is part which lead me to donating some work to the sick and disadvantaged children out there. I have lived with type 1 diabetes and all of its complications for 24 yrs and recently ( 11 months ago ) began dialysis due to End Stage Kidney Failure. But what really got me involved was losing my daughter 16 yrs ago too Heart defect at 15 days old. Due to not being able too work any longer I no longer have the means to purchase supplies to continue donating or keeping my home business of selling these blanket and pillow sets going. With your help I can not only get my business back up and running but also be able too begin makingaand donating these sets. I appreciate you taking the time to read my story.\n'

u'\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are planning to produce the full feature film in 2016. But first a twenty-minute short film will, which is a sample of the full feature, is the principal step in order to establish the appearance and the narrative arc that will be conveyed in the completed film. The full feature film is intended to be a co-production between Germany, Switzerland, and producers in the United States.In both films, the feature and this twenty-minute short, we will show the specific turning point where the original good intentions transformed and became destructive under a positive guise. \nAt the moment, the second version of the feature script has been completed. A project such as this is a great financial challenge, so we are making a short film, which will contain the same themes and content, in order to attract additional investment.The shooting schedule will be during the six-week period, July 4th through August 22nd, 2014. Second unit shoots are likely to follow in the subsequent months.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy we need your help!Through the Filmakademy, the \r\nshort film has already secured a budget of $95,000. This money is being \r\nused for equipment rental and for several postproduction facilities that have \r\nalready been booked. The crew of this short film has committed their \r\ntalent for no salary. In order to take \r\ncare of the people involved in this shoot \u2013 to pay for hotels, to provide propper catering, and to reimburse them for their travel expenses \u2013 we are asking for the additional funding of $10,000. Apart \r\nfrom this, more equipment must be rented close to each of the \r\nvarious locations.\r\nYour donation breakdown: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0Synopsis\n\r\nJanus has a gift. He has a strong bond with nature and knows how to draw from the tree\u2019s mana to heal. Born into the ravages of World War I, his ambitions to help save his nation become compulsive. And when the Green Reform movement in Germany began to blossom, he is intoxicated by the idea of creating a better world.\n\n\n1933The film begins with a colorful depiction of the reform movement in Germany and Switzerland. The\r\n main characters, Janus, Franz and Matilda, are introduced at an event \r\nwhere organic food, vegetarianism, and homeopathic medicine are \r\ncelebrated as the peak achievements of the reform movement.  Intrigued\r\n that their ambitions will lead Germany out of the depressive post-war \r\ncrisis, they share an euphoric moment. They recognize that modern society\r\n surrounding them is becoming distressed by a lack of direction and a \r\ngrowing rate of strange diseases of civilization. They discuss how the \r\nravages of the great depression and industrialization that hit the \r\nnation all too sudden seem to be the underlying cause of these effects.\r\n Unsettled in their beliefs of the technical revolution, the science, \r\nand the flaws of modern society, they collectively try to figure out a \r\nhealthier way for society to subsist and prosper. \u201cBack to \r\nnature,\u201d is the new credo and the journey seems to begin with a \r\ntriumphant boom. Janus is the most gifted one, and when the Nazi party \r\ntakes over and they declare their intention to support alternative \r\nhealing methods, Janus is intoxicated by the idea of creating a better \r\nworld with state support like many others around him. The idea that \r\npolitics will be providing for the health of the nation sounds like a \r\ngood thing to him. He accepts a job offer to work on a vast herbal \r\nplantation as a researcher to develop healing techniques, a job offer he\r\n can\u2019t refuse, but should have.Under the pressures of such \r\nstressful times, Janus learns that the creation of a better world \r\nhe had envisioned requires an uninterrupted selection of good and evil, which under the \r\nnew National Socialist leaders means a selection of worthy and unworthy individuals. Having a career on the plantation means he must command\r\n prisoners of a nearby concentration camp. It is one of the prisoners, \r\nBalthazar, which compels him to contemplate the differences between \r\nfollowing the logic of a political system and the free will of one\u2019s \r\ntrue self.When events grow more and more out of hand... it is \r\nbetween Janus and Balthazar that a new interpretation of good and evil \r\nis exchanged. \n\n\n\n\n\xa0To give this sensitive issu propper care, we must ensure that the imagey\xa0 is of high production value. For the 20 minutes short we shoot this summer we trust in the talent of Christine L\xfcdge. \n\n\n'

He has a strong bond with nature and knows how to draw from the tree's mana to heal. Born into the ravages of World War I, his ambitions to help save his nation become compulsive. So when the Nazis offer him a job on a vast herbal plantation, where they produce alternative medicine, he is intrigued and ruthlessly accepts that plantation work is carried out by prisoners from a nearby concentration camp. Whilst his career flourishes and he gains power, a nagging doubt grows ever stronger in him: is it really possible to heal one's own people when destroying another?\xa0\n\n\n\nIt is our aim to produce a feature film in this fascinating, yet jarring setting. We are structuring the project as a co-production between Germany, Switzerland and the United States.Financing a project such as this is a great challenge. In order to attract additional funding, we will first produce a twenty-minute\xa0short film. In terms of content,\xa0creativity and narrative style, this\xa0will give potential investors a very good idea of the feature length film that we intend to make.\nWe are shooting and editing this summer. The short film is a co-production of the prestiguous Baden-W\xfcrttemberg  Film Academy\xa0and the German TV Bayrischer Rundfunk.\xa0We will be filming between July 4th and August 22nd.Your donation will directly support the shooting of the short film and thereby enable us to go on pursuing our bigger goal of developing and financing the feature film.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy we need your help:The budged secured through German Filmacademy and German TV is being \r\nused for equipment rental and for several postproduction (editing, color correction, rendering and music recording). The crew of this short film will not be earning a salary. We do hope to raise funds in order to pay for hotels, proper catering and travel expenses \u2013 wherefore we need to raise $10,000.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe story of Janus is fictional but is based on historical facts.\xa0When after World War I Europe was in ruins, a hopeful, perhaps 'alternative' movement began to grow strong in Germany and Switzerland - it was a movement that believed in the return to nature as a remedy for all the illnesses modern society had brought upon them. One of their main objectives\xa0was to create an unspoilt medicine that would use the powers of nature to heal. Up to 12 millions of Germans joined this movement. It was so successful that by 1933, half of all 'doctors' in Germany were alternative practitioners.When the Nazis came to power, they were greatly interested in this trend, to the extent that they designated 'alternative medicine' as the official medicine of the country. Many reformers and healers greeted the new political party with great enthusiasm, only to followed them down the very same path where their ideals would give way to corruption. For the laws of nature to which the Nazis adhered, had very little to do with the reformer's original ideas of natural healing.\xa0The real historical plantation near Dachau's concentration camp memorial site is still witness to this relatively unknown part of German history. As unbelievable as it may sound, throughout World War II, whilst observing strict bio-dynamic principles,\xa0tons of\xa0medical herbs were planted and harvested on this plantation.\n\n\n\n\nWe chose Christine L\xfcdge to be our cinematographer for this short film, because of the immense sensitivity she demonstrates in all of the projects she has filmed to date. We believe that her attention to detail and the way she works with natural light is perfect for the vision that our director has for this project.\n\n\n"

u'\nTO MEASURE WITH MALICE\xa0BRIEF SUMMARY1858 - Jeshua (Jesus) is a Shepherd on the Underground Railroad sent to help and free slaves on the Blatche Plantation and guide them to the Promised Land (Canada). During the first attempt at an escape, a female slave is captured and is left behind by her husband and their children. With the capture, an angry Overseer looking for the responsible person for the attempted escape, unleashes a gripping and powerful story of loyalty and betrayal.ABOUT ME:My name is Johnavon Miller and I have a passion for film and film making. My love for film started when I was 12 years old after seeing the film The Ring. Every since that experience I have devoted my life and energy to film. I recently graduated from film school where I directed and completed three short films have worked on a dozen or more films both short and feature length. Now I\'m embarking on journey and a mission to become the best film-maker I can possibly become and I need your help to get me started.WHY TELL THIS STORY?To be honest with you, it is quiet interesting to me to tell the story of Jesus in a setting that has not been done. It gives a different perspective of the life of Jesus hoping that one could relate with Jesus in an non-traditional aspect.\xa0WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO ACCOMPLISH?The overall objective is for this film to be seen anywhere in the world. This is not a film for myself and do not want to do it so I can say, "Hey, I made another short film". I want to be able to make a film that is memorable and I could be proud of. Once the film is completed, the plan to enter it in major film festivals across the U.S. such as:\nSundance\nTribeca\xa0\nCannes\xa0\nSouth by Southwest\nNew York Film Festival\nAustin Film Festival\nWHAT HAS BEEN COMPLETED SO FAR?I have been working endlessly, putting in long hours to get to this point.

u"\nLate one\nnight, many years ago, while I was visiting Tom at the ranch, he asked if I could\nhelp him. He told me that he had an obligation\nthat he needed to fulfill and couldn\u2019t do it alone. I said, \u201cYes, Of course.\u201d\nTom was my mentor. He was my friend.\nThe obligation was to his great\ngrandmother, Isabelle, a woman who died 30 years before Tom was born. In 1985\nduring a remodel of the family ranch house, Tom found a trunk plastered into\nthe walls. In the trunk Tom discovered the possessions of a young boy,\nIsabelle\u2019s son, a boy named Johnny Quiggle. Johnny died of Typhoid Fever in\n1885. He was only 10 years old. \nTom believed\nthat he had an obligation to tell\nJohnny\u2019s story. Why else would Isabelle have plastered a trunk with his toys\nand clothes into the wall? She written notes and placed them in and among the\ntoys. She wanted the trunk to be found. She wanted Johnny\u2019s story to be told. That's what Tom believed.\nSo, over\nthe next two years, through hundreds of hours of interviews with Tom, a much\nbigger story of legacy and loss emerged. I wrote a script for Tom to perform.\nMusic for the play was composed and compiled by the great band, Mom\u2019s Chili\nBoys. It was during our first public workshop, a reading &play through of\nthe script, that we saw the first signs of Tom\u2019s dementia. He got lost. For a\nfew horrible moments he didn\u2019t know where he was. We knew, as Tom knew, that\nwe\u2019d missed our opportunity. \nTom passed\naway over a year ago yet his obligation\nto Isabelle is now my obligation. His legacy is my legacy. I am the keeper\nof the story as we are all keepers of family stories. I promised to help him so\nI\u2019ve reworked the play. It\u2019s mine to tell, now. There\u2019s new music from the\nChili Boys. I intend to meet my obligation and I need your help to tell his\nstory. There\u2019s a theatre to rent. Sets to build. Technicians to pay. Rewards to send;-) I\nappreciate your support.\n"

u"\nWe are looking to secure funding to help us how grow our own-brand clothing & accessories range. Our clothing range follows a seasonal theme, the most recent being based around 'Dystopia', with the clothing collection taking design cues from around the theme.\n\nA shot from our SS14 Lookbook\n\nOur handmade accessories include heavy duty canvas & waxed cotton wallets & pouches, all of which are made in Scotland using fabric that is also made in Scotland, handwoven lanyards & homewares. Our aim is to provide excellent quality products to consumers without the astronomical price-tag that usually accompanies them.\n\nA shot from our SS14 Lookbook\n\nThe Cartocon Co. began life as an idea by three friends in January 2012. The initial plan was to create a small t-shirt line to sell locally through an online channel and through a local independent retailer. Initial costs were spent on garment research, creating a fully-functioning & transactional website & on our first order of clothing.As of we now have three different stores stocking our brand and its products, all of which are well respected & successful independent retailers. We have also expanded our range as time has gone on, as well as t-shirts, we now create a line of sweatshirts, hoodys, homewares, handmade leather goods & other small accessories, most of which are made right here in Scotland.Towards the end of 2013, we made the decision to expand our online store & begin stocking other like-minded brands & designers. As of June 2014, we stock ten other accessories & homewards brands & we also stock a range of independent publications, too. We will be further expanding online later this year as, for the first time, we will be stocking other premium clothing & footwear brands online.WWW.CARTOCON.CO.UK\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\r\n\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\r\n\xa0\xa0\n"

u'\n\nBencoolen and I are teaming up to shake up the indie rock world. It would be easy to shoot a one-song, 4 minute music video, but that\'s boring. Our goal is to create a music video that encapsulates their entire debut EP (four songs). Inspired by other notable works such as "A Hard Day\'s Night," "Quadrophenia," and\xa0"Scenes from the Suburbs," "Waiting Room" is a film that weaves through a man\'s memories of his last years on Earth. The story is set in the near future, when a select group of people are chosen by NASA to participate in the Mars One program to help establish a colony on Mars. Once these people land on Mars, though, they can never return back to Earth. The film follows one fictional participant as he reminisces about his life on Earth and wonders if leaving everything he loved behind was worth an attempt to advance the human race.\xa0\n\nBencoolen opening for Cold War Kids 8/30/2014\n\nThe video\'s script was written in a way to flow with The Bencoolen EP. The finished product will be a mix of cinematic drama and a more traditional music video montage style. the video will be shot in the Northwest Florida region, primarily in and around Pensacola. We believe NW Florida is a vastly underutilized area in filmmaking and we hope that shooting the music video here we can help promote the local film industry, as well as provide new voices both for music and for film. Bencoolen guarantees a new, interesting voice to the indie rock scene, blending the sounds of Radiohead, Arctic Monkeys, and other modern rock bands whilst sporting an alto saxophone player: a hark back to the jazzy rock of musicians like Gerry Rafferty and Supertramp. I think our styles mesh together in a way so that a wholly original and unique product is the least you can expect from our collaboration.\n\nNewspaper excerpt (The Cheshire Herald) about Bencoolen\n\nHere is a short video made to show what the non-narrative parts of the final music video will look like (this is not a part of the final video).\n\nSo why do we need the money? Simple: we want to deliver a top notch product. That means that we want professional sound, video, acting, and editing. We don\'t want this video to be on par with other indie rock bands\' music videos; we want it to stand out among the rest and set a precedent for all future music videos. Of course, when the goals are this ambitious, the costs tend to be pretty high. We estimate a cost of about $5,000 for cast and crew alone (actors, cinematographer, professional sound, and editor), and about another $5,000 for props, equipment rentals, securing locations, food, and transportation. That being said, many pieces of equipment are already readily at hand, which is why our budget for equipment is relatively low. Nonetheless, there are some pieces of equipment we are not in possession of that are necessary to film this video (e.g. a small crane jib). In short, we need your support to ensure that we can create a standard-setting product.\xa0\n\n\xa0An example of one of my videos.A link to the band\'s website:https://bencoolen.bandcamp.com/releases\n'

u'\n\nThe IdeaA 20 minute music video, and not just of one song, but four. It will feature an immersive and entertaining narrative to go along with the band\'s killer tracks. Featuring an ensemble cast, it\'s a hark back to the days of "A Hard Day\'s Night." We\'re looking to the past to bring indie rock forward.The BandBencoolen is an indie rock band from Washington DC. After releasing their debut EP, they\'ve already had the pleasure of playing with acts such as Cold War Kids and Wings of Apollo. Consisting of 2 guitarists, a bass, a drummer, and an alto sax, this jazzy rock band is sure to be a breath of fresh air among all the boring pop and club music circulating today.\n\nBencoolen opening for Cold War Kids 8/30/2014\n\n\xa0The PlanIf our campaign is successful, we plan on shooting in Winter and having a final cut ready by Spring. We already have a small team of filmmakers and actors gathered for the shoot, and we will do our best to make sure that this video is made to our utmost standards. We will make a standout video for a standout band. Plain and simple.\n\nNewspaper excerpt (The Cheshire Herald) about Bencoolen\n\nWhy Do We Need Money?This isn\'t a student film dealing with non professional actors and crew. Everyone on set will be a professional in their field, which means that they expect some kind of pay. Factor in an ensemble cast encompassing several locations, well, that\'s a lot of money and quite a bit of time. We need money also for equipment (camera rigs, data storage, etc), transportation, food (I\'m not going to starve my cast and crew), as well as for some work in post production. It all adds, up, which is why we\'re asking you for money. Your donation will help bring Bencoolen to success, and maybe to the radio. Now I know you\'d rather listen to them than the usual manufactured rubbish.\xa0A link to the band\'s website:https://bencoolen.bandcamp.com/releases\n'

u'\nThe Beard Bible was thought of when I put down my razor. The beard is a symbol of masculinity and strength and I feel it needs to be appreciated. What better way to appreciate it than create a cult underground club of beard loving enthusiasts? From people like Karl Marx, Freidrich Engels, Abe Lincon and Charles Darwin all the way to the modern age facial forests of ZZ Top, Zach Galifianakis and Hugh Jackman the beard has always been a way of expressing yourself and making your claim to manliness. With the last bearded american president being Benjamin Harrison in 1889 and the gradual decline in beard popularity around the same time the beard has been switched out for the more popular sissy \'clean faced\' look. The trends do look disturbing but as we all can see they are also slowly turning. Lately the beard has been regaining some of its greatness and slowly creeping into the spotlight again. Lets help it creep faster and get the beard recognized. Put down the razor and make a stand-iness for your manliness!!!\n\nCharles Darwin\n\nBOOK CONTENTS: \xa0The contents of the book are not yet set in stone but they will include topics such as \'Beards through time\', \'What is a beard\', \'Beard styles\', \'How to care for your beard\', \'Strange beards\' and \'Beard memoirs of the Bearded man\' among others. The Beard memoirs is what I am most excited for as 10 of you lucky people plus 10 or so of my choosing will have their beards in the spotlight. Each section will answer questions like \'What does your beard mean to you?\' \'Why did you grow your beard?\' \'Has your beard helped you in life?\' \'Would you shave for 1 million dollars?\' etc. etc. The book will also contain a section at the front that I like to call the \'Bible Verses\'. These verses are fictional guidelines and rules of how to grow a beard and be a bearded brethren.\xa0"When two beards meet the bigger and thicker beard has the higher authority.\xa0Acknowledge his patience and determination and see him as \ta \u2018Beard Elder\u2019 for he is wise in the way of the beard. "-Excerpt from The Beard Bible.50% of the profits will be donated to mensline Australia to help support the sufferers of mens mental illness. I have a facebook page in place here:\xa0https://www.facebook.com/pages/Beard-Bible/779101382122307\xa0that will have updates news and fun stuff. I plan on creating a website in the next month to get some more hype and I will be releasing merch like beard combs, graphic t-shirts, mugs with moustache guards and more.\xa0Thank you so much for pledging and I know together we will bring about a better future for the beard.\xa0\n'

u'\nHow many projects out there support men\'s mental health by celebrating the most manly thing out there? Not many. In all honesty, the help for men\'s mental well-being is sparse.\xa0So, I am taking the beard and using it to promote awareness and change the way people see the stigma of \'being manly\'.\xa0\n\n\nHow many men do you know that suffer from mental health challanges? You probably think not many, right? You would be surprised to know that 1 in 6 men suffer from depression at one time in their life. In reality you probably know at least one man who is facing challenges of the emotional kind. Why don\'t you know who they are? Therein lies the problem that men today face.\xa0"Its a sign of personal weakness.""It makes you less of a man.""Anyone with willpower will \'snap out of it\'.""True men don\'t need to worry about emotions."These are just some of the reasons men don\'t seek help for such challenges. If you were told you had diabetes would you seek help? If you were told you had epilepsy would you seek help? Today, 80% of suicides are males, and a great number of these men were never engaged in professional help. Depression is an illness or adjustment of the mind and men should feel comfortable to seek assistance and support.\'Awesome cause, keep up the great work!!!\' -Jason Hutt (review on Beard Bible\'s facebook page)I want to take the beard, the most common icon associated with a man, and use it to spread the word and support a good cause. Writing a book about beards has been something I wanted to do since growing my own, and using it to help out an amazing cause is the icing on the cake.\xa0My book will include topics such as:-Beards through the ages-Beard care-Beard styles-What it means to wear a beard (chapter on being a man)-Beard memoirs (profiles of real people with real beards)\n\nCharles Darwin and the wise beard.\n\n\'Why Beard Bible?\'\xa0I chose the name Beard Bible not for biblical reasons but because there will be a section where I will write fictional \'Beard Bible Verses\'. The main idea started with that and the rest followed. Hopefully it will also act as a bible of sorts to the bearded men out there who are so passionate about facial forests.\xa0Along with the book, my project will include startup funds for the website and merchandise. Merchandise includes things from T-shirts to specialized mugs. From the sales, 50% of profits made will be donated to mensline.org\xa0to support men in their challenges. .\xa0I have come so far with the support of some amazing people and groups, but now all I need is the help of people who care and people who love beards. Even pledging a minimum of $1 is a step closer to helping an amazing cause and helping me with my dream of writing a book. Buy it for a friend or a bearded husband or even spoil yourself to a good read. Helping this project not only helps me but it helps the men out there who are to afraid to speak up and get help.\xa0Grow a beard, Make a pledge, Help a man.\xa0\n'

u'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid, Scott, Ollie, and Mike met at Techshop Pittsburgh when it first opened in March 2013.\xa0 They all came from different backgrounds, using the resources at Techshop for all sorts of different projects, but what brought them together was an exciting idea Ollie hatched:\xa0 making a laser cutter that you can bring anywhere.\xa0 He wanted to etch the skyline of Pittsburgh into his own DIY coffee table, but unfortunately his table wouldn\'t fit in the standard laser cutter bed, at least not all in one piece. \xa0Instead of giving up, Ollie embarked on inventing the tool that could complete this challenge: a portable laser cutter. \xa0 He knew he couldn\'t do it alone, so he approached the three biggest nerds in Techshop.\xa0 Scott, David, and Mike immediately embraced the idea and jumped into engineering the prototype.\xa0 They quickly discovered that they work well together, and are all driven by creativity, a love of innovation, and odd working hours.\xa0 The prototype quickly went from paper to fabrication.Meanwhile, Ollie approached local start up accelerators and was happy when the Idea Foundry accepted\xa0Red Ant Lasers into their accelerator fellowship program, providing the group with $50,000 in funding and support. With this funding, the team officially setup the business, applied for patents, and finished the first prototype.\xa0 They called it the "Origami".\n\nSee more videos on our YouTube channel.Now Red Ant Lasers brings their engineering prototype to the crowd funding community to get the support needed to grow the company. \xa0 With successful funding, Red Ant Lasers will not only build 25 portable laser cutters, but they will set-up the business side of things from filing paperwork to setting up manufacturing processes to tackling international protocols. \xa0This campaign will Kickstart the team into a business.\n\n\nRead more about the Red Ant Laser team by clicking the "See full bio" button to the right. \xa0You can also visit our website www.RedAntLasers.com. \xa0Meanwhile, here is our smiley picture:\n\nIn the shop with the first Origami prototype. From left to right: David, Mike, Ollie, Liz, and Scott.\n\n\n\nThe Origami is a 40-watt laser cutter which can cut or etch most organic materials (wood, acrylic delrin, textiles, paper, rubber, cardboard, and glass.) \xa0\n\nsample of materials cut on the Origami\n\nWhat makes our laser truly unique is its flexibility. \xa0You can take the Origami anywhere: trade shows, craft fairs, parking lots, your garage, your mom\'s garage... and you can store it easily on a shelf by just folding up its cutting arm.One cool thing the Origami can do is etch on vertical surfaces. \xa0Check out these videos:\n\n\n\nYou\'ll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\n00:00\n\n00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA close-up.\n\n\nMore fascinating technical information can be found on our FAQ page below. \xa0Also, you may send us a message with a particular question. \xa0\n\n\nThe Origami laser is portable. \xa0 It folds to save space, and it can be used in a variety of orientations (horizontal for tables, vertical for walls and windows, etc.). \xa0 It has no limiting enclosure so users can create monumental works of art by indexing and moving the laser across the work area. \xa0 You can take this laser to wherever and to whatever needs lasering.  And really, what doesn\'t need a good lasering? \xa0(The answer is obviously people and animals -- please use your laser responsibly!)\xa0The secret to the Origami\'s versatility is its patented folding arm technology as well as its self-contained ventilation system. \xa0 No giant hoses and special electrical hookups are needed to run the laser;  simply carry it to your project, plug it in, open the arm, and begin personalizing your world! \xa0 (Proper safety goggles are important, as with any laser.)\n\nThe Origami, folded for portability.\n\n\nThe Origami on its back.\n\n\n\nIf the staff didn\'t kick us out at night we\'d probably sleep at Techshop.\xa0\n We\'ve built virtual prototypes in Autodesk Inventor, machined the \ncustom aluminum parts on the Tormach CNC mill, turned down stock on the \nlathe, waterjet cut the exterior panels, soldered and tested the electronics, sand-blasted, powder-coated, and assembled functioning prototypes, and relied on the Techshop community to \nbe our focus groups and testers.\xa0 Working in this environment is not only convenient, but it is also creatively inspiring.\xa0 We work alongside other inventors and project teams who are open and willing to share advice, tools, and even spare parts.\xa0 \n\nA year of prototyping and testing.\n\nFor our Kickstarter project, we\'ll be doing all the machining and assembly in-house at Techshop, Pittsburgh.\xa0 Techshop allows us access to machinery that would normally be cost prohibitive to a start-up.\xa0 By keeping the build process in-house, we\'ll side-step many of the typical production and delivery problems that plague other tech hardware projects.\xa0 Plus, working in Techshop is fun.\n\n\n9/23- Red Ant Returns from Maker Faire with Awards!While at the New York Maker Faire, we received our "Staff Pick" award from Kickstarter and an "Editor\'s Choice" award from the\xa0Digital Fabrication Editor of\xa0Maker Media,\xa0Anna Kaziunas France.

Thanks everyone!\n\nEngineering Prototype Receives Maker Faire Blue Ribbon!\n\n\n\n\nWe are very excited to finally be at this point where we can crowd fund our company\'s development.\xa0 Our local community of artists and makers has been helpful in development up to this point.\xa0 Now it\'s time to spread the support -- thank you!\nYou can chip in any amount you\'d like to our campaign.\xa0 Here is a list of rewards, though, for those of you who want some tactile satisfaction:\n$5 -- "Chip In for a Shout Out" -- This pledge amount is for anyone who is \nexcited about portable laser cutting and wants to help us get the word \nout.

The ancient Chinese believed it to be the only path in between the Heaven and the earth, the only passage for gods and men to commune.The Winston's, an American family, composed of father, John Winston, owner of the global Happy Bubble drink, and mother, Mary Lee who has Chinese back ground, and their three teenage children, Ali, 18, who loves music and dance, Danny, 16, the Winston's in house scientist, and Austin 14, a loving boy, the Winston's friendship ambassador.\tThe three children were all born with faint gold finger prints on their ten fingers tips.In the year 2020, on their visit to China, The Winston's met a mysterious old man who told them the three Winston's children were the chosen ones, they were born with divine golden heart and destined to restore faith, hope and love back to the earth, at the end time. It was a severely corrupting era when people were deceiving as if normal, killing as if fun, selfish and think only themselves, and hurting each other instead of loving one another.With the advise of this mysterious old man, the Winston's family came to the Middle Heaven by the passage within the legendary world tree. The old man also gave a small silk pouch to each of the three children for emergency consultation. The Middle Heaven is a land beyond the rainbows, where people are vegetarians and lives to thousands of years, and all animals are herbivore and can speak with people. Big lion and tigers are farming and ploughing in the fields, and eat grass.In the Middle Heaven the sky is alive, clouds are like cotton candy motioning and shaping into different themes, one day it's a floral garden blooming with a variety of flowers, and the next day it's an ocean aquarium showcasing colourful fishes swimming happily. It\r\n was so much fun. People always get a nice surprise in the sky every day.Meanwhile, The emperor of Darkness sent his most notorious devilish team, Temptation, Greed and Jealousy, plotting a master plan to trap the Winston's in the this wonder land forever so that the devils can further corrupting the earth, and bring total destruction to man kind.There was a millennium race taking place in the Middle Heaven and the Winston's were invited to join by their new friends Duke Cirrus  and prince Hina. The winner would be awarded with the golden Pegasus. In the market place, the Winston's each got their flight  gears, from Sky board to chi Lin, and winged turtle. Ali found the flute of love which she was destined to play divine music with, and Danny found king David's lyre which young David played music for king Saul when evil spirit came upon him. Austin made new friends easily with his Happy Bubble drinks with god of Sting Bugs and god of Rain and Storms and princess Miyola.The Devils tricked Austin and the parents into buying their mud trick flight gears, an evil plot to sink the Winston's into deep water and drown. God of Sting Bugs and god of Rain and Storms also joined the Big race and in time saved the Winston's.Entangled young love sprung among the new friends, Lady Citrine loves Prince Hina, Duke Cirrus loves Ali, and Ali and prince Hina fall in love with one other. There were plenty of opportunities for the devils to exploit and destroy the young love and hurt their hearts.The blue Dragon god bestowed Austin one of his dragon scales so that he was able to save the Winston's from their peril danger in the Blue crystal palace under the ocean when encountering the ocean monster. Princess Miyola took the boys to the rainbow lake and met Hou Yee who was the greatest archer that shot down nine suns in the fiery sky. In the rainbow temple, seven golden ravens were living there and making rainbows in the sky as their duty. Hou Yee also join the race riding the golden raven.\r\n The millennium race had begun. There were especially designed games and competition that were so intriguing and challenging. In addition, the devils carefully plotted their dirty tricks in the games that many a times tripped the Winston's and other contestants into their snare. The Big race was not a mere skill competition, it was a moral contest that one has to pass the challenge to compete their own human weaknesses. Has the Winston's passed and won the race?\r\nWho eventually awarded with the golden Pegasus?This story can be written with continuous episodes after episodes With exciting story lines.\r\n"

u"\nThe very nature of work and society is changing. Please help me publish what I hope will become the definitive book on how we got here, where we are going, and the technological, social, economic and humanitarian impact this transition may have.\xa0A book eh?  Sounds original!  What\u2019s it about?\xa0\nThis book is about our evolution and the technological revolutions that have shaped it in the past, and will become more influential in the future. This includes investigation into the historical, economic and social environments that are required in order for industrial and technological revolutions to take place, and how these revolutions are likely to shape the evolution of mankind and the significant impact that will likely have on our economic and social structures moving forwards.\xa0\nAs such, it is part commentary, part detective story and part projection of the future.  It is about beginnings and transitions, of the past and the future.  How we got to where we are now, the impact this has had and where this is likely to lead.   It is about industrial beginnings, robotic transitions and the likely outcomes that may lead from this.\xa0\nSounds heavy.  Why would I be interested in this?\xa0\nEconomics, history, social theory \u2013 I agree that all sounds heavy and academic.  But fear not, dear potential supporter \u2013 it\u2019s anything but.   This is exciting stuff.  It is a book about the future, but in order to understand the future we need to also understand the past.   Not the boring stuff we sat through in school, but the research and development of a unique framework that enables us to understand where we are now, how we came to get here, what\u2019s happening right now and where could this potentially lead us.\xa0\nSo it\u2019s one of those techno-optimist / doomsday books then?\xa0\n\xa0No \u2013 but you raise an interesting point.\xa0\nTo date, the book that looks at technology and the potential it brings fall into three basic camps:\xa0\nWe\u2019re all going to die\xa0\nWe\u2019re all going to be replaced by robots (and then probably die)\xa0\nWe\u2019re all going to become Gods and live forever.\xa0\nThis book doesn't fall into any one of these sensationalist categories, but at the same time in part two evaluates the possibility of all of them.  In the first half of the book I take a historical perspective and analyse the social, economic and industrial frameworks that have developed across the world, and how it has given rise to a truly global economy; but one not so very different to what went before.   In the second half of the book I discuss both the potential positive and negative economic, societal, and humanitarian impact that the oncoming exponential advances in technology may have, and extrapolates the likely outcome based on the research undertaken in the first half.\xa0\nHasn't this been done before?\xa0\nNot really, and nothing like what is being proposed here.  This book has a very unique perspective, and questions any existing paradigms that the reader may have. \xa0F. Scott Fitzgerald once stated that 'the test of a first rate intelligence is\nthe ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still\nretain the ability to function'. and certainly that's what I'm trying to achieve in the second half of the book - show both sides of the argument about where this is leading, and the possible outcomes of these developments. \xa0I'm quite convinced that it will not only capture your\xa0curiosity, but also your\xa0attention! \xa0(yeah OK - so I kinda stole that line from DiCaprio...)\nA new dawn is on us, and the impact that this will have on our lives will put the first Industrial Revolution to shame.   The book investigates these new technologies, what they are, where they've come from and what impact they are having not just on the existing paradigms, but on the potential for science and technology, the economic models that exist, society as a whole and whether this will change our view of the world and humanity\u2019s place in it.\xa0\nIt has taken centuries for these levels to be defined, but due to the rapidly accelerating rate of innovation and technological change they will all change dramatically by the end of this century.  This is an unprecedented level of change in a small amount of time \u2013 and we are not prepared.  Mankind is used to one maybe two major changes in society over their lifetime \u2013 now they will have to adapt to this level of change every decade, if not more.\xa0\nSo, it\u2019s an investigation and historical study designed to develop a framework that allows us to understand the economic and social environment needed to enable the successful development and adoption of exponential technologies - innovations that could change the very nature of the economy, society and our place in the world, either elevating us into new realms of wealth, health and knowledge - or resulting in the utter destruction of mankind. \xa0Is this correct?\xa0\nEr, yeah - actually that's pretty close.\xa0\nOK. Got it.  Is it interesting?\xa0\nVery much so.\xa0\nGiven you're not a renowned historian, economist, sociologist or futurist - what exactly qualifies you to write about this then?\xa0\nGood question; and one I've asked myself numerous times during my moments of self-doubt.   Although I do not fit into any one of those nice \u2018academic\u2019 categories, I like to think of myself as what Peter Diamandis described as \u2018one of the world\u2019s unheard voices\u2019.   That being so, I am a well published author of numerous business articles in magazines such as The World Financial Review, The European Business Review, Chief Executive Officer and Director of Finance magazines, as well as numerous Supply Chain publications.\xa0\nI'm also an awarding winning presenter and speak at numerous events, as well a respected advisor to corporations on business transformation, strategy, supply chain excellence and developing engaged, high performing teams.\xa0\nOne of the articles I wrote for The European Business Review back in 2012 was called \u2018Transformers.  Supply Chain 3.0 and how Automation will change the rules of the Global Supply Chain\u2019.\xa0\n\nTransformers Article\n\nThis article formed the kernel of the idea for this book, and due to very positive feedback led to my creating a keynote presentation on this subject matter. This presentation has constantly evolved and led to the research that forms the basis of the book, and which I have presented as a keynote presentation at events in places such as London, Frankfurt, Istanbul\xa0and\xa0South Africa.\xa0\n\nPresenting my keynote on this topic in Sun City, June 2014\n\nBelow I have attached a video of my presentation in Istanbul in May on this subject - unfortunately I run out of time at the end before I have chance to go into the social and economic impact of these changes to the global Supply Chain, but hopefully there is enough to whet your appetite!.\n\nAlthough the presentations, webinars and articles were all very positively received, my research had made me well aware that they were also incomplete snapshots of the whole picture, and that the rabbit hole went far deeper than I could ever describe in a 4000 word article or a 45 minute keynote, but I didn't know how deep - and that fascinated me.\xa0\n\nWinning the Kingfisher award for the Most Innovative presentation in Sun City, June 2014 on the topic of the book.\n\nSo, what started off as an article purely about Supply Chains and the impact technology (specifically automation and robotics) is having on their shape, strategies and structure, and the impact on the workforce needed to run them, has now been turned into a far-reaching research project and resultant commentary on the social, political and economic impact that this \u2018revolution\u2019 is about to have on the world.\xa0\nIt has also required me to delve deep into the past, to research the social structures and world views that were necessary to spark the engines of industry and automation, create revolutions in technology and the globalisation of the world through capitalism and fall of old cultures and beliefs.   This has led to comparisons between the past and the present, but also requires peering into the crystal ball to project the future. \xa0Here my research led me into a new and ultimately revolutionary brave new world, a world that is yet to come, but which, according to whatever pool of thought you follow, will either lead to our ultimate evolutionary stage, that of shedding the limitations of our biological construct and creating a world free of hunger, disease and ageing, or it will cause periods of social revolution, disparity and death.\xa0\nBy bringing together the different elements into a single narrative new observations can be made, new discussions generated and new perspectives formed.   It is a journey that has completely consumed me, excited me, challenged me, scared me and overall changed me and the way I view the world and its future.\xa0I hope it has the same effect on you.\xa0\nI am now at the stage where the research is complete, the book\u2019s structure defined and materials collated.  It just needs to be written and that needs time away from distractions, but also ensuring that the book is well marketed, promoted and publicised.  Oh \u2013 and to ensure it has fantastic artwork.\xa0\nArtwork?\xa0\nYep.  I have researched and recruited the services of a fantastic California based artist, Houston Sharp, to produce a series of illustrations called \u2018The Janus Trilogy\u2019 one of which will adorn the cover of the book, and the other two will kick off the start of parts 1 and 2.\xa0\nYou can see some of Houston\u2019s existing work here: http://houstonsharp.deviantart.com/gallery/?offset=0\xa0\nJanus Trilogy?  As in the Roman God Janus, the God of Beginnings and Transitions, and of doorways and passages?\xa0\nBlimey \u2013 you know your Ancient Roman History!  Yes, \u2018ol two-face himself. \n\nJanus, in his full Roman glory\n\nJanus is used on the cover to represent the full arc of the book from the Age of Steam to the point where we create intelligence greater than our own, what some people have come to call the point of \u2018Singularity\u2019. \xa0The cover of the book therefore will feature a full-cover representation of Janus, called \u2018Transition Point: From Steam to the Singularity\u2019.   Here Janus\u2019s two faces are that of James Watt, father of the Industrial Revolution, and a representation of what the evolution of intelligent life on this planet will look like. \xa0\nA rough mock up of this is at the top of the page - it'll give you the idea but I did this with Powerpoint and limited artistic skill. \xa0However Houston's version will blow your mind - which is why I decided to include posters, prints and clothing with the image on; it'll be iconic.\nPart One of the book is introduced by an illustration called \u2018Creative Destruction 1.0: Engines to Eyewear, Industry to Intelligence, England to Everywhere\u2019, where  Janus takes on the faces of James Watt, inventor of the steam engine, and Sergey Brin, CEO of Google wearing his Google Glass device. \xa0It's a pretty cool image.\nJanus is also used to represent gates, doors and passages, and thus I also use him to reflect the passageway between the number of future social and economic challenges that may or may not end well.\xa0\nThus, in Part two of the book Janus changes his faces (and his sex) to become that of Pollyanna, the eternal optimist, and Cassandra, the daughter of King Priam and Queen Hecuba of Troy, blessed with the gift of prophecy but cursed to never be believed. \xa0Houston\u2019s illustration is called \u2018Creative Destruction 2.0:  Pollyanna Prosperity or Cassandra Catastrophe.  Evolution or Endgame?'\xa0\nSigned copies of two of these designs\xa0are available as rewards, as they are going to be completely awesome. \xa0\xa0They will be on prints, posters, high quality T-Shirts and brilliant Hoodies. \xa0The 'Transition Point!' T-Shirts and Hoodies will be printed with the following images:\n1. 'Janus: Steam to Singularity' image on the front, and 'Are You Ready?' wording on back\xa0\n2. 'Janus: Pollyanna or Cassandra' illustration and 'Evolution or Endgame?' wording on the back.\n\nThe artwork will be fantastic by the way\u2026which is why you can order rewards that include signed posters, prints and also T-shirts and hoodies with the \u2018Transition Point: From Steam to the Singularity\u2019 image on, or the \u2018Pollyanna or Cassandra: Evolution or End Game?\u2019. Both are going to be awesome. \xa0The posters and prints will be personally signed by Houston.\nSo just select the appropriate reward package at the side. \xa0\nGo on, you know you want to...\xa0\nExpand on the 'Pollyanna and Cassandra concept - I'm not sure I follow?\xa0\nIn the second part of the book we take the framework developed in Part one, and the lessons learnt from it, and we look at the positive and negative implications that these changes will potentially bring.  Will they bring a utopian future, where the need to work to survive is removed, enabled by a labour force of machines that do the dirty, dangerous and dull jobs, freeing the population in order to spend its time in more creative activities that invoke the cerebrum and enhance mankind?   Can we put an end to war, waste and suffering, solve the problems of the planet, provide energy sources that do not pollute and poison and extend ourselves beyond our biological limitations?\xa0\nOr will the future be dystopian, aligned with the social issues and technological challenges prophesied in science fiction films such as Elysium, Transcendence and The Matrix? \xa0Will the people who own the machines care about the people replaced by the machines? \xa0Are we really thinking this through? \xa0 Who's values will the machines have? Who decides? \xa0What if they make their own?\nOK \u2013 you got me going now. Why exactly do you need funding?\nNumerous reasons \u2013 but the main one is that I don\u2019t just want to write a book, I wanted to write THE book.\xa0\nThis, however, brings a number of key issues \u2013 rather than just self-publish electronically I want to publish the best possible quality book I can \u2013 and that means multiple medium including high quality hardback, paperback, electronic and audio. This requires professional copy editing, design, development, artwork, marketing etc. It also requires months and months of research. I wrote the original article back in 2012 and since then I've been researching this topic extensively. In October 2013 I took a major risk and stopped work till mid-January 2014 to write a book based on my presentation / article. However, as mentioned I didn't realise just how deep the rabbit hole went, so those months, and the ones since, were instead spent digging into historical analysis, social theory, economic models, technological developments and exploring the world of the futurists, scientist and industrialists who are working together to move us ever closer to a brave new world. I've joined numerous groups, hung out with people from around the world and listened to some fantastic perspectives. One thing has become very clear \u2013 this work is needed, there is nothing like it out there, it needs to be done right, it needs to be done now and it can\u2019t be done part time.\xa0\nThe funding will be used for the following:\nBook development and design\nMultiple rounds of professional copy-editing and proff-reeding\nCover and internal artwork by acclaimed illustrator Houston Sharp\nPremium Colour Printing in both hardback and paperback\nAudio-book production\nBook storage and distribution\nDesign, production and shipment of all of the lovely clothing and printing rewards\xa0\n'Transition-Point' website design and development\nMarketing\xa0\nBoring stuff like ISBN codes, Kickstarter's fee,VAT etc\nWhy Use Kickstarter?\xa0\nThe book deals with the creative destructive nature of technological innovation, and as such details elements such as the way new disruptive business models have arisen in reaction to the restrictive nature of old ones.  New models are created, destroying the old.\xa0\nOne perfect example of that is what has happened to the publishing industry through the development of digital books, self-publishing possibilities and new publishing outfits. \xa0I also cover what has happened in the world of financial funding when the banks withheld credit during the economic collapse of 2008 and beyond \u2013 i.e. the development of crowdsourcing platforms like this one.  Innovation, like nature, always finds a way.\xa0\nSo \u2013 given that I will be including sections on the development of these new business models to support the exponential growth of innovation, the least I could do is to use them in the development of the book.   It at least allows me to talk about them with experience!\nWhat happens if the funding total isn't reached?\nThen you\u2019ll see a grown man cry. \xa0\nSeriously, if it doesn't reach the minimum, none of the supporters will be charged a penny and the book doesn't get published this year. \xa0I will then endeavour to find other means to support the hopeful production of the book, which may take quite some time as it\u2019ll take me a while to recover from selling my kidneys.\nI thank you from the bottom of my heart if you decide to help make this project happen. I\xa0guarantee that whatever reward level you go for, you will be pleased that you sponsored this project. \xa0\nI am incredibly excited by what I am developing, and I cannot wait to share it with you. \xa0\nWhat happens if the\nfunding total is exceeded?\nRewards will be continually upgraded if the total is exceeded, with additional artwork and clothing finding their way into people's rewards. \xa0\xa0\nIf it is exceeded by 100% then\xa0I will also analyse the main areas where supporters are from and travel to that area, inviting the sponsors to personally join me at a book event, meet me\npersonally and discuss the topics contained in the book.\nI might even stretch to buying coffee and\ncake\u2026nice cake as well.\n\n"

u'\nSay goodbye to the Industrial Age! \xa0We are arriving at the transition point to a new phase of our evolution \u2013 one that is tied inextricably to technology, and which will influence every aspect of our lives. \xa0\xa0The dawn of the Age of Intelligence will either liberate us...or destroy us. \nThe determining factor is how WE as humans choose to respond to this technological evolution.\xa0\nThis is a book about the past, present, and future. It is a story of scary and uplifting possibilities, told within a framework of scientific data, historical and social narratives, multiple perspectives, and in-depth research.\xa0\nIt is not:\xa0\na doomsday book\xa0\na techno-optimist fairytale\xa0\nsensationalist or polemic propaganda.\nIt\u2019s not just about how \u201call our jobs are going to be replaced by robots\u201d, how \u201cwe\u2019re all going to die from nano-tech grey goo / terminator robots / AI takeover" (delete as applicable!), or even how \u201cwe\u2019re all going to become gods and live forever\u201d. \xa0\xa0Unlike currently published books on this subject, this book attempts to present a balanced & multi-faceted view.\xa0\nIn the first half of the book, I take on a historical perspective to\xa0analyse\xa0the\xa0social, economic, and industrial frameworks that have led up to this point: a defining and unique period of humanity\'s existence that put all other periods to shame, yet at the same time not so much different from what came before. However it has been a period of mass disruption, disruption caused by the power of economy, profit, capitalism and industry.\nHowever, the next 100 years are going to be unlike anything we have ever seen. \xa0In the second half of the book, I discuss both the potentially negative and positive impacts that oncoming exponential increases in technology will have on our economy, society, and sense of what it means to be human.\xa0\nI have already completed all of my research and compiled the data and information I need. \xa0I\u2019ve even finished some chapters of the book already. Now I need your help to be able to dedicate all my time and focus to writing this book for you, as opposed to trying to fit it in. \xa0It deserves my undivided attention, it deserves to be properly edited and published. \xa0It deserves to be done right.\nSince I\u2019d like to keep this description short and concise, I will omit the specific details here. But if you are interested in knowing more, or if you simply want to verify how much research and writing I\u2019ve done, just email me and I will happily answer any and all questions you might have!\xa0\nYou can publish an e-book for free nowadays using services like Lulu. So why are you trying to raise $18,500?\xa0\nThat is a good question, and my reason is simple: quality.\xa0\nWhat do you mean?\xa0\n1. Many e-books nowadays are not edited properly for simple things such as grammar and punctuation. That\u2019s the job of a professional copy editor and a developmental editor, who are trained to spot mistakes that most people would glaze over. Their services cost a lot, thousands and even tens of thousands of dollars.\xa0\n2. E-book conversation also costs a pretty penny if done well. Most e-books are not laid out correctly and the pages are not designed optimally for multiple reading devices. I want my book to be read seamlessly and laid out perfectly, whether on a Kindle, a tablet, a Mac or a PC, a smartphone, or on a projector.\xa0\n3. I need to be able to pay Houston Sharp, the incredibly talented artist who is currently creating all of the artwork for my book. There will be quite a few pieces, and trust me\u2026they are gorgeous. Here\u2019s a link to his portfolio so you can see for yourself:\nhttp://houstonsharp.deviantart.com/gallery/?offset=0\n4. I want to make my book available in all forms: as a paperback, a hardcover, an e-book, as well as an audio book. \nRemember what it feels like to hold a brand-new book in your hands, where you can thumb through the pages and smell the aroma of newly pressed information? \nWith an actual book, you can hold it in your hands and SEE each page as a manifestation of someone\u2019s hard work and energy. You can see and feel the artwork that is used to symbolize and place emphasis on certain words. \nI think there is still tremendous value in having paperback and hardcover versions of a book. \xa0Libraries and bookstores still exist, a LOT of people love to hold and own a book not just a digital version, and people still use them, especially in developing and third world countries.\xa0I also intend for my book to be distributed internationally, after all.\xa0\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the funding:\n\nTransition Point!  The Book.  Funding breakdown.\n\nInterested? Here are some of the rewards I humbly offer:\n\xa0\nBooks! \xa0Signed and personalised hardbacks and paperbacks, plus audio and e-book versions.\nArtwork! Posters and prints of the cover and internal art by up-and-coming Californian illustrator Houston Sharp. \xa0\xa0\nA sneak peak at the design stages of the book artwork: \xa0\xa0\n\nColour scheme sketches - first draft\n\nClothing!  The artwork makes its way onto high quality T-shirts and Hoodies.  Two styles to choose from, either \'Industry to Intelligence\' (the cover art), or \'Cassandra or Pollyanna\' (the internal art for Part 2, looking at the Dystopian and utopian possibilities).\n\xa0\nPersonal experiences! Either 1:1 discussions, exclusive webinars or on-site presentations and discussions about how this might affect your organisation. \n\xa0\nExclusive Events!  VIP entrance to major conferences that Sean is speaking at in London, New York or Sun City.  Includes 5* accommodation, 1:1 dinner, entrance to the full event etc.  \nDISCLAIMER:\nI am not a historian. I am not an economist, sociologist, or scientist. I do not even consider myself an expert on futurism. But that\u2019s exactly why I am qualified to write this book.\xa0\nMy lenses are not tinted with impassioned optimism or dark disappointments from past experience. I do not have blinders on from any particular field. I do not write about this subject matter from the viewpoint of a narrow industry. \nNo, I am simply an interested and curious academic who has had lots of speaking, writing and research experience. \nSo how did you become so interested in this topic? \xa0 Back in 2012 I wrote on article for The European Business Review called:\xa0\u2018Transformers.  Supply Chain 3.0 and how Automation will change the rules of the Global Supply Chain\u2019.\nI was absolutely fascinated by the way technology has changed every aspect of supply chains (i.e. the entire structure of our economy) and continues to do so. I began doing more and more research\u2026and thus down I fell down the rabbit hole. \nSo, what started off as an article purely about Supply Chains and the impact technology (specifically automation and robotics) is having on their shape, strategies and structure, and the impact on the workforce needed to run them, has now been turned into a far-reaching research project and resultant commentary on the social, political and economic impact that this \u2018revolution\u2019 is about to have on the world.\nThis presentation has constantly evolved and led to the research that forms the basis of the book, and which I have presented as a keynote presentation at events in places such as London, Frankfurt, Istanbul\xa0and\xa0South Africa.\xa0\nBelow is my presentation at a conference in Istanbul in May this year:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_rygtKO5yg\n\nWinning the Kingfisher award for the Most Innovative presentation in Sun City, June 2014 on the topic of the book.\n\nIt has also required me to delve deep into the past, to research the social structures and world views that were necessary to spark the engines of industry and automation, create revolutions in technology and the globalisation of the world through capitalism and fall of old cultures and beliefs.\xa0\nThis has led to comparisons between the past and the present, but also requires peering into the crystal ball to project the future.

u'\nIn 1971, Hunter S. Thompson rampaged through Las Vegas searching for the American Dream in a continuous state of drug-addled madness.  The absurdity of this premise along with Thompson\'s claim to be a "monstrous reincarnation of Horatio Alger" are what make Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas such a depraved and entertaining adventure. \n\n\nFor most people, Las Vegas is the dystopian antithesis of everything Horatio Alger had in mind in the mid-19th century when he wrote rags-to-riches American stories that hinged on integrity, perseverance, and a little luck.  Today, if you had a son who told you he was moving to Las Vegas to seek fame and fortune, you would probably cringe, and if you had a daughter who told you she was moving there to seek fame and fortune, you would probably cry. At least these were my thoughts as I read the recent Wired magazine story about Tony Hsieh, CEO of Zappos.com, and his Downtown Project - http://www.wired.com/2014/01/zappos-tony-hsieh-las-vegas/. For those who don\'t know, downtown Las Vegas was the original hot spot for debaucherous fun before it migrated out to the Strip beginning in the 40s.  There have been efforts over the past decade to rejuvenate a small 4 block stretch of the old casinos, but until just recently most tourists were told to simply avoid the area after dark.  And yet, this is the milieu into which Tony Hsieh has chosen to plow $350,000,000 of his own money to create an "entrepreneurial tech nirvana," anchored by a genuine community of intelligent, conscientious, and real people. It is natural to feel skeptical when hearing about this grand social experiment for the first time.  My numerous personal experiences in Las Vegas have inclined me to think of it more as the unrestrained outlet of human nature that Hunter S. Thompson sensationalized - a giant neon oasis filled with crazy buildings, unnatural lights and sounds, surgically enhanced women, and free booze; all designed to appeal to our animal desires and trigger an explosion of irresponsible, reckless, and financially draining behavior. But I was fascinated by the possibilities of propping up a modern startup culture against this backdrop of loosely controlled insanity, so I read Mr. Hsieh\'s book, Delivering Happiness.  A partial autobiography and history of Zappos.com, the book\'s primary focus is on the culture and community of the Zappos workplace and the dedication of the management to measure success not only in terms of financial profits, but also in terms of customer, vendor, and employee satisfaction.  Mr. Hsieh believes that the purpose of wealth is not to build giant offices and mansions with locked doors and gated fences to insulate you from the world around you, but to use it as a tool of social enrichment that helps facilitate the kinds of personal interactions that underly a large part of human happiness. \n\n\nIn a famous passage from Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Hunter S. Thompson reflects on the spirit of the San Francisco counter-culture movement in the 1960s and says, "We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave... So now, less than five years later, you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look West, and with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high-water mark \u2014 that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back." Perhaps the wave of optimism and hope in the 1960s did break and roll back to its source in the Bay Area, but perhaps a new wave is rolling out from Silicon Valley.  Perhaps the lessons of the 60s were actually digested by the mainstream, with the most nutritious parts being absorbed into the lifeblood of corporate America.  Perhaps hippie has bred with yuppie to create a new breed of optimistic, passionate entrepreneur who knows that for any social movement to be sustainable over the long term it must be fueled by more than love and good music, it must be cash positive and have a healthy line of credit.  And perhaps Mr. Hsieh has the right kind of eyes to see the possibility of a thriving, progressive entrepreneurial culture taking root in Downtown Las Vegas.This blog will chronicle my experience joining the Downtown \'movement.\'  I have an old website I put together in high school that still gets a significant amount of web traffic - www.shotgunrules.com.  I don\'t make any money with it right now, but with a little help from the right people, it has some potential.  So I\'m heading to Vegas to see what kind of people I meet and to try and monetize my website, and to report on what I find.  A modern day gonzo journalism adventure - a sober journey to redeem the American dream. \n\n\nhttp://purehoratioalger.blogspot.com/2014/06/a-sober-journey-to-redeem-american-dream.htmlAt the end of summer, if the journalism experiment is successful, I will edit the blog posts and weave them into a 50,000 word eBook.\n'
Current:
u"\nA lot of headlines have been written recently about the death of the American Dream.  Chronic unemployment, a widening gap between rich and poor, and the rapid changes brought on by new technologies have all helped create uncertainty and angst about the future.  As a result, many people no longer believe a clear path exists in America that will afford them upward social mobility and empower their hopes and dreams.  The Main Nerve is a new gonzo journalism project being conducted by Thomas Reuter, a journalist from Colorado who has relocated to Downtown Las Vegas Nevada in order to start a technology company and paint a picture of modern startup culture and the opportunities this culture offers to a new generation.  \r\n\n\nJuxtaposing themes from Hunter S. Thompson\u2019s classic Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas to highlight the opposite nature of his own journey, The Main Nerve chronicles Mr. Reuter\u2019s attempt to take advantage of the infrastructure being created by the Las Vegas 'Downtown Project' to learn about crowdfunding and succeed in business in a way that reaffirms the American Dream and illustrates a new path for others to achieve this dream themselves.Mr. Reuter says he was inspired to undertake this project by past setbacks in pursuing his own dream. \u201cI made the mistake of buying a newspaper in 2008, and after that experience I decided I had better embrace new technology if I didn\u2019t want to find myself on the losing side of it again.\u201dMr. Reuter\u2019s first attempt at exploring the ins and outs of crowdfunding is the first gonzo journalism Kickstarter project approved under Kickstarter\u2019s new \u2018Journalism\u2019 category.   The goal of this project is a modest $750, 33% of which was achieved by the 4th day of the project launch.  The project is slated to wrap up on the 4th of July, a symbolic completion date that underscores the goals Mr. Reuter hopes to achieve.

u'\nSummary\xa0Over 50 years after the Civil Rights Movement, we find ourselves still segregated in America. Especially on Sunday mornings, at churches across the nation. \xa0We tend to cling to our own race, ethnicity or cultural comfort zone. We\'re worshipping the same God but only with those who happen to look like us.\xa0There is movement happening in American Churches that is relentless about breaking the racial divide within the church walls. With passionate and charismatic pastors and pioneer congregants to lead, this story will help viewers see the need for this movement in their own communities.Why are we making "The Colors of God" Documentary?Over the past year I\'ve been running into church leaders and having conversations about their desire to be more welcoming to the varying races and ethnicities that were not represented in their churches. Now this intrigued me because I started in film to make culturally diverse media. I want to see more shorts and films with characters that look like the America I see. I started to research this issue and according to LifeWay Research, 51% of Americans would be most comfortable at a church where multiple ethnicities are represented. The article also said that 78% say that every church should strive to be more diverse.\xa0But, what does the Bible say about this topic? In Matthew 28:19, Jesus says to the disciples "Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost". Yes, ALL Nations! ALL Races! ALL People!Considering everything that people were saying around me, my research, and my passion about the topic, I felt compelled to do this project. I didn\'t want this to be just a black and white thing but show what it looks like when you get many different colors of people together within American Church culture. Thus, "The Colors of God" was born.\xa0Production\xa0Time\xa0LinePre-Production: June 14, 2014 - July 10, 2014Production: July 12, 2014- April 5, 2015Pos-Production: March 1, 2015 - June 26, 2015Community Engagement: November 3, 2014 - August 8, 2015\n\nPastor Jimmy Rollins after speaking in Tampa, Fl on stereotypes\n\n'

u"\nWhat\xa0would you do if\xa0you were all of a sudden facing a stranger in the mirror instead of your own reflection?This exciting original short narrative\xa0film presented by\r\nBlue John Productions, will be a\xa0contemporary surreal Drama/Comedy loosely\r\nbased on the Greek myth of Icarus that might well be screened on British TV. We just need your help to fund it :Synopsis: A magic realist, quasi Si-fi absurdist comedy. Hero, Casper, is led by a mysterious red light to an abandoned mirror yielding a reflection of a strange woman instead of himself. He subsequently learns that this stranger is no other than his feminine double from a counter-earth located on the opposite side of the sun; the mirror offering the only way of communicating with residents from this inverted world. This gives Casper the impetus to engage with his female counterpart but he is hampered by the girl\u2019s synchronised movements cast by the mirror which stands between them. He seeks a way to speak to her to find out who she really is \u2013 a part of himself or a separate entity with their own mind. The purpose of\r\nthis film is to explore the thin line between fantasy and reality and the\xa0extent\xa0to which we negate our true nature due to\r\nsociety\u2019s pressures and demands. Furthermore,\xa0it\xa0tackles how much we are compelled to adhere to stereotypical\r\ntrends. The\xa0short, which will be shot in mid\xa0September, will\xa0be brought to life by a great\xa0cast and crew, some of whom have worked for us before.\xa0\xa0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy We Need Your Help\nNow that the\r\nfilm is in pre-production, we need funds in order to get through production and\xa0post-production. Basically to make things happen\r\n it's all\xa0down to you wonderful people. These costs include paying for: Actor's expenses, hiring equipment, logistics and van hire,\xa0locations and permits,\xa0wardrobe,\xa0an editor, sound design,\r\nmixing,\xa0as well as securing music rights.\xa0These people are kind enough to give us\r\nlower rates and donate a lot of their time and commitment:\nThe script for The Flight of Iro and Casper has been recently edited by John Parker. The next stage, after the appropriate funding has been raised, will be casting, crewing and location hunting.  I will be relying on the sites which have served us well throughout our previous projects, Mandy and Casting Pro.\nThe production will take around seven days to shoot mostly at internal location around south-east London.  It should take place in late September, depending on whether funds can be raised on time.\xa0\nCrew and Cast for The Flight of Iro and Casper\nCinematographer \u2013 Foad Emrani Sound           \u2013 Monica Gonzalez Production      \u2013 Anna Gwi\u017cd\u017cLighting        \u2013 Nick Ng Editor          \u2013 Kosma Director        \u2013 Paul Herbert\nDr. Luomi       \u2013 Karina Knapinska\n"

u"\nWe will be blasting ourselves back into the lost domain of late 60s surreal\r\nSi-fi, reminiscing over tragic black comedy. An\r\ninnovative\xa0plotline interwoven\xa0with colourful characters, analogy and vivid imagination,\r\nyes, folks you\u2019ll sure have to put on your\xa0thinking caps for this film. Our short film \u2018The Flight of Iro and Casper\u2019 presents \r\n Casper, a disenfranchised, nobody office worker, who one day\r\nencounters a strange woman standing in for his own reflection in an antiquated\r\nmirror.\r\nAfter a number of encounters, Casper soon learns that this mysterious image is\r\nsomeone whom he finds himself drawn to. So what is happening to our\r\nhero? Is this person real? Is she part of some crazy dream, or is Casper simply\r\nseeing things? Or perhaps someone is playing a trick on him? The film depicts a\r\nthin line between fantasy and reality; it explores the human condition in a\r\nsomewhat comical, surrealist, metaphorical way; it reflects on our strong ties\r\nwith social norms. Foad Emrani, Nick Ng and\r\nMonica Gonzalez are all seasoned contributors to short films. Cinematographer\r\nFoad\u2019s last feature film has played the festivals and cinemas in Iran and\r\nTurkey, and he has been working on feature films, shorts, national TV and\r\ndocumentaries for the past twelve years.

So we're looking for an\r\ninjection of cash to provide the best for the production. The best cast and\r\ncrew is required with also the best equipment and locations. Our short project lends itself to the conventions around film noir and therefore requires convincing props, lighting and design. There will be actor's travel expenses, equipment hire, van hire,\r\npermits,\xa0wardrobe, sound design, mixing,\xa0as well as securing music\r\nrights. And, hey we need to feed everyone! So, this is what we need the\r\nfinance for. To make the best possible film we can.All of our contributors will\r\nbe a part of this project. As well as the DVD copies and premiere invites we\u2019re\r\nmaking available, we\u2019ll also be keeping all backers regularly updated on 'The\r\nflight of Iro and Casper via email.Make A DifferenceWe think that modern sci-fi\r\nfilm is swaying away from creative plotlines that are different, engaging and\r\nare analogous of the human condition. We hope this short will lead to a series\r\nof new films based on story and character, rather than hiding under the guise\r\nof special effects and bloodiness and gore.We have the majority of our\r\ncrew and cast consisting of strong, extremely talented, up and coming actresses,\r\nKarina Knapinska, who is ready to make their name for herself in British cinema.We hope you'll be there at\r\nthe launch of this revitalisation.Other Ways You can\r\nHelpIf you are unable to dig\r\ninto your pockets, you can help us in so many other ways.Spread the word!

As of today, 115 Tisch actors are listed.The 2014-2015 school year will be the site's first full year, and The Actors Catalogue is ready to be your one-stop casting resource.Why we need you: this fall, The Actors Catalogue is moving to a new online home, which will accommodate its growing audience and will be a better host for all the new features the site will have to offer. This means money, unfortunately \u2014 between paying for the domain, the host, troubleshooting, and upkeep, there's some cash needed in order to keep things running. If it's just me paying, it's pretty expensive. If everyone chips in, it's hardly a dent.This site is still in its baby form, but it has shown promise of turning into something that will truly redefine the way arts students create their projects. Your donations will make this endeavor possible.The Actors Catalogue is not affiliated with or endorsed by NYU or Tisch School of the Arts.\xa0\n"

u"\nUPDATE:\xa0WOAH! We've almost doubled our goal! Amazing! Thank you so, so much!The original goal of $400 accommodates some of the price of legal stuff (hello, Actors Catalogue, Inc.!), some advertising, and moving the site from Tumblr to Wix. With your support, we can do so much more.STRETCH GOALS:$900: Hire a computer programmer! Because let's face it, my self-taught HTML knowledge will only get us so far. This means we won't need Wix and will be able to make a much more unique site.$1100: OMG! A better programmer! Who likes pretty websites? I do. You do too.$1500: Launch party? Launch party.$1600: Financial stability.$2000: Launch party with clowns/balloon animals, even better programmer, snacks.$2500: Jake will produce a film featuring every member of The Actors Catalogue. Maybe.________________________________________________My name is Erica Pappas and I am an acting student at New York University\u2019s Tisch School of the Arts.NYU has world-class programs for both acting and film, but for a school so adamant about fostering collaboration, it hardly offers bridges to close the gap between these two departments that are entirely codependent on one another. That is, NYU doesn\u2019t offer much means of introducing film and acting students to each other.So in April, I created The Actors Catalogue, accessible at www.theactorscatalogue.com. The idea is simple: Tisch actors send me their head shots and resumes to be listed on the site. Then, film students who need to cast their projects log onto the site, scroll through the headshots of hundreds of Tisch acting students, click on the photos of the actors that interest them, and can receive contact information. From there, an artistic project is ready to be made.I launched the beta version of The Actors Catalogue in April, and it has met tremendous success far larger than I'd imagined. Its audience has grown exponentially and word of the casting resource has buzzed through NYU Tisch. All four class years and all six acting studios are represented on the site, and site traffic passes a hundred hits every day.Right now, The Actors Catalogue is being moved to a more self-sufficient webhost with brand new design, organization, privacy features, and a beautiful new interface. The improvements will help hundreds of acting and film students get the experience they need to make a serious splash in the professional industry. The Actors Catalogue is totally free for users, but hosting a web domain is not. There\u2019s no money flowing in, out, or around the project. This Kickstarter is its first shot at generating some cash to make the upgrade and upkeep possible. Please, if you have interest in art or art schools, consider making a donation or sharing. I run The Actors Catalogue, Inc. completely on my own, and I am very passionate about its growth and success. Your donations make a world of a difference. Together, we\u2019re going to redefine the way art schools approach collaboration.The Actors Catalogue, Inc. is not affiliated with or endorsed by NYU or Tisch School of the Arts.\xa0\n"

u"\nThe Running Man will be a very simplistic game. \xa0I need to have the game programmed, which will take up to 7 months to do once I have the funds needed. \xa0As soon as I have the money, I will initiate programming of The Running Man. \xa0The current goal before the game is released is to have the main character, Frank, as well as the first continuous level complete as well as all the other basic functions of the game. \xa0I will add on many other things to the game as I am able to, such as more characters (female and male characters), different levels, more customization capabilities, two-player mode, and most of all competitions. \xa0These competitions will happen on a weekly basis, allowing gamer's to show off their skills to players all over the world.\n"

u'\n"The Running Man" is about an average guy, like you an me, Frank. \xa0He was wrongfully imprisoned by his government, and sentenced to life in prison. \xa0Lucky for him, the media is sadistic, and turns a game show into something of an evil nature. \xa0They take "volunteers" such as Frank, and puts them in a course, promising them freedom if they complete it. \xa0This course is long and treacherous, which is where you the navigator will help him conquer it. \xa0You will have to navigate through the course, dodging boulders, jumping over rocks, and swimming under water, doing everything in your power to stay alive.This game is played from the side, in a continuous manner. \xa0Much like the well known game "Flappy Bird", you will continuously move forward at a ever increasing speed. \xa0More things will be added to the game, such as the ability to purchase lives, shields, and other things to help you while navigating the course. \xa0Also, new characters will be introduced throughout time. \xa0A competitive mode will be added, allowing you to compete against other players around the world, in addition to competing in tournaments in the hopes of winning prizes of various natures.\n'

u'\nI am wanting to film a feature independent project from start to completion. I require two quality cameras, lighting equipment, a vehicle mount, etc. I am filming in the local area. Actors from Southern Illinois University at Carbondale will be used. I will require grips, make up, etc. I will do most of the post production myself, after I purchase the proper software. I will outsource where needed. I have a plan on what needs to be done, I just lack the funds to accomplish the task. I ask of you to believe in me and there will be a healthy return. I am dedicated to this project and it will be completed. I have a great work ethic and I understand what needs to be done. I thank you for your time and hope you support me.\n'

u'\n\xa0What am I going to do with such a tiny bowl?In the beginning when I gave these bowls as gifts people were really confused. I explained the love that went into each one and uses.

These tiny bowls have brought so much joy for my friends and family.\xa0\n\n\nInstead of a pet rock have a pet \xa0"Tiny Bowl". These bowls are food-safe and dishwasher-safe. Just be careful you do not lose them in the dishwasher.Each bowl is hand-sculpted with clay by me and then fired in a Kiln. Then painted and fired one more time in the Kiln. Hopefully then sent to your home so you can enjoy them. This project helps funds more crafts and art projects.

u"\nI recently worked on a Cambridge University project to help children with Autism recognise emotions in faces they'd never seen before, by swapping around people's faces digitally - they see their own face making an emotion, and they might empathise with it more easily.\xa0This summer, I'm working for Microsoft in Egypt. The streets are lined with soldiers and tanks. Listening to political debates back at home, a lot of people have very strong opinions about military intervention - in the month I've been here, it looks like somebody's going to invade Giza, Libya, Iraq and Syria.\xa0So that's where I came to this project. Aren't we all a little autistic in our treatment of war and conflict, especially when it's so far away? There's been unprecedented peace in Europe in the last half-century: can this tranquillity lead to a na\xefve jingoism?\xa0This artwork (part performance, part interactive, part digital, part physical sculpture) has a clear function: to bring us closer to the realities of war, to make us think more carefully about it. To critique, at the same time, the commercialisation, the consumerist 'sexiness' of conflict: from the movies, to video-games, to children's toys.\xa0Like the autistic children, who could see their own image showing an emotion, I propose to build massive sculptures. Literally thousands of 3D-printed toy model-soldiers, each one with the face of a 'backer', who in this case is equally my co-artist and co-audience: contributing directly and physically to the work, critiquing it, investing in it, viewing it. The backer is also a consumer: exploited by the artist as he commercialises conflict and death.\xa0You feel the attachment to conflict by seeing a soldier in your own image, as you might do in a video-game. But these toy soldiers all represent, individually and statistically, the deaths in specific conflicts.\xa0This haunting and powerful image can be re-combined to make powerful statements on current and past conflicts. Every time enough backers support the project, a new sculpture is made.Think of the sculptures as massive, physical infographics: one might tell the story of the casualties in the Israel-Palestine conflict, or the Iraq war. Red soldiers would be military, green soldiers would be civilian. These allow the artwork to be extremely powerful, but also unarguably factual. The fact that the face of every soldier is different, and human (just like the original Terracotta Army) is a particularly terrifying thought.\xa0HOW DOES IT WORK?-You give us a nice webcam photo of yourself, either through our web interface or our App!-We make your 2D photo into a 3D model of your face, using nice complex computer-graphics-We use this model to 'graft' your face onto the 3D-model of a toy soldier-Your toy soldier is then saved on the system. You, or anybody else, can view it in the app, download it, print it yourself. But more importantly...THE SCULPTURE-Your model is used as one of thousands, as part of a massive sculpture on conflict.-'Tablets', consisting of a platoon of 50 soldiers, are 3D-printed. Tablets are formed into a collection of stories, which explain a narrative through world conflict.\xa0-The tablets form the basis for a physical exhibition, which is then displayed as an embodied interactive artwork in a gallery.\xa0\n"

u"\nLike most of you, I've never been in a war. For the last seventy years, Western Europe and North America have known peace.\xa0Indeed, after the horrors of World War Two and the inhumanities of genocide, the idea of soldiers going through Paris or Berlin now seems unthinkable. \n\tAnd yet, many nations today are at war. In the last decade, Iraq, Iran, Palestine, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Syria have all known the terrors of armed conflict, leading to millions of deaths \u2013 and spiralling to countless other conflicts. At home, media pressure on politicians, to bomb this place or that, is often too tempting to resist. At the same time, a huge weapons industry has built up in the West, with guns often ending up in the wrong hands for the sake of a few dollars' profit.\xa0So what does this have to do with art?\xa0Well, I think the experiences of the proxy wars of the last couple of decades show that we in the West need to be more engaged with conflict. I think that part of our eagerness to go to war is often due to the fact that many of us only know it through rolling news, the cinema, or video-games.  And I think it's the responsibility of art to give us a different view.\xa0In my work, the Digital Terracotta Army, you, at home, physically become part of a huge sculpture. You take form of a small toy-soldier \u2013 not unlike those you might have played with as a child, or in boardgames like Risk. With a selfie, taken by our app, your face is scanned \u2013 and automatically built into a 3D-model, using similar technology to some of the CGI in the movies.\xa0So we have you, or a toy-soldier you'd instantly recognise as yourself. The work doesn't stop here. You're now 3D-printed in extremely high resolution, one of a platoon of hundreds of soldiers, all standing to attention on the same tablet. Each soldier looks almost the same, and yet each is very slightly different. And this terribly dramatic, quite spooky scene is then used to tell a story about a war.\xa0In the first sculpture, we tell the story of the Israel-Palestine conflict, in 2014 only, in terms of the number of deaths. Here, each toy-soldier represents not one, but ten deaths. There are 102 soldiers in black, for one-tenth of the military deaths. 164 soldiers are in red, these are a tenth of adult civilians. And 58 of them are in white \u2013 these are one-tenth of the children who've died so far in the conflict this year. \n\tImagine the scene, more than three hundred toy soldiers, children's toys \u2013 ten deaths for each one.\xa0But humans aren't very good at understanding statistics, especially when they're so vast. And that's why your contribution is so important. Just like the Terracotta Army in 200BC, on close inspection each soldier bears a different face. The human impact is huge. \n\tSo, I'm asking for you to give five pounds for you to appear in this sculpture. Every soldier must have an identity, a background, a childhood, a love-story, a tragedy \u2013 without it, the work is just a statistic. And I want you to do more than appear \u2013 I want you to come and see it, to pull faces, to send me suggestions, to download the models from the website and print your own, identical version of the sculpture, exhibit it in your country, or maybe even make a new one and tell a different story.How does it work?\xa0-You give us a nice webcam photo of yourself, through the html5 web app. \xa0-We make your 2D photo into a 3D model of your face, using sophisticated computer-graphics\xa0-We use this model to 'graft' your face onto the 3D-model of a toy soldier\xa0-Your toy soldier is then saved on the system. You, or anybody else, can view it in the app, download it, print it yourself. But more importantly...\xa0The Sculpture-Your model is used as one of thousands, as part of a set of sculptures on conflict.\xa0-Each sculpture, consisting of a platoon of hundreds of soldiers is 3D-printed in very high-resolution. The sculptures aren't random - each one serves to illustrate a different aspect of\xa0-The sculptures form the basis for a physical exhibition, which is then displayed as an embodied interactive artwork in a gallery.\xa0\n"

u"\nThe Sounds of Christmastime. That conjures many different memories to different people, but each year when the air gets a bit colder and the season gets a bit jollier, the Atlanta Vocal Project spreads the essence of Christmastime sounds by performing your favorite holiday songs with a quality and fun that is among the best in the Southeast. It\u2019s been a while since we captured that essence in the form of a CD, and we feel our continued improvement, growth, and new repertoire makes this the perfect time to record a second studio album to let our fans take home that unique AVP Christmas sound.\nUnder the direction of Clay Hine, Atlanta Vocal Project is Atlanta's best men\u2019s a cappella chorus specializing in the barbershop style. Our vision is to enrich lives in every generation in our surrounding communities through performances, music education, school system programs, and community activities through the lifelong benefits of a cappella harmony singing and performances.\nThis CD project is the next step toward achieving that vision, but we can\u2019t do it alone. Help us to enrich lives by donating to our Kickstarter campaign. The funds you raise will help cover the costs of professional recording studio sessions, high-quality post production mastering, licensing fees, and physical materials to release a finished product you and your family will enjoy for many years.\nWe have already begun recording ten new holiday tunes, some our fans have heard in recent Christmas concerts, and others being performed for the first time this year! Selections include fun, jazzy versions of Christmas classics like Jingle Bells and Santa Baby, beautifully stirring songs like Away in a Manger and White Christmas, and of course our unique, crowd-favorite rendition of the Nutcracker Suite as only AVP can pull off (or get away with)! We\u2019re lucky to have a director who is also a world class arranger, and as most of our charts are his craftsmanship, we bring top-notch a cappella music to the public year after year.Our goal is to have this new CD ready by early December so it can be ready to be enjoyed by all our fans for the holiday season and spread to as much of the community as possible. It has been an aggressive schedule, but so far our singers have done a fantastic job learning and perfecting these great songs, and we are truly proud of the product that is coming your way soon. If the project goes well, we are even considering a second CD to be recorded this spring to bring some of our other repertoire to you! If we receive enough funding here above our goal, your contribution will then go toward making that second CD a reality.\nSo don\u2019t miss out on this opportunity. Be a part of our vision for an a cappella Christmas!\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\u201cAVP is the single most stunning group that we have ever had perform with the LSO in the past 14 years!

u'\n\n\nA MESSAGE FROM PRODUCERS:\xa0Three\xa0years ago we embarked on a journey to\xa0bring Lawrence\'s script, Under The Radar\xa0to fruition. Upon\xa0locking down talent, director and crew\xa0we immediately came to YOU, the fans, with our hopes you will help us see this series come to life. And creating and building a social media presence ended up being the best decision we ever made. Through the ups and downs of these last years,\xa0many have stood by us and for that we are forever thankful, but we\'re not yet done. In Hollywood, artists\xa0fall under only one of two types: the powers that be, or, those who are trying to become...\xa0it\'s quite simple really.\xa0And the climb to \'become\' has never be more difficult at any other point of history in Hollywood than it is now. Because ideas great and small, talent short and tall, are a cliche dime-a-dozen. So, with overwhelming odds what is it that separates this production from the\xa0overwhelming masses? In our (humble) opinion, that too is quite simple... it has been our relentless determination, a great script, a great\xa0director, top-notch studio-level talent, consulting by one of the best real-life bounty hunters in the filed, Joey Garner, and by retired bondsman, Jimmy Fagrell... and let\'s not forget about an endless supply of faith and fan-based support! But even then, no matter how palatable ones idea, faith, talent or  determination\xa0 may be, without money to help bridge the gap between idea to concept, good dreams, no matter how riddled with monumental success, will end up on the shelf and collecting dust alongside a thousand other near-misses. So we: our production and those behind it stay that rolling stone, steering the course day by day gaining momentum at every turn, proving to many that this series is something more than unique- its potential for studio-level interest is a very real conversation.WHAT WE WANT & WHAT YOU GET:\xa0We need\xa0finished contributions by no later than Friday, September 12th as production is officially slated for the last week in September- and that date is quickly coming upon us. And depending on your contribution\xa0many of you will receive things like a\xa0limited edition producer\xa0T-shirt, back-links to view episode, "special thanks" in credits, etc.\xa0Many of you\xa0will even get the coffee-cup to go with it. But\xa0depending on ones contribution some (or one) of you will not only receive a producer credit, a walk-on guest appearance on the series, a speaking role,\xa0tickets for two to the VIP wrap party and Hollywood screening of Under The Radar, someone will have a truly rare behind-the-scenes opportunity assisting director, Frank Pinnock direct a scene in the series! So, if contribution is possible, if you would like to be part of the UTR family, helping us pave way to production, be it\xa0with $5.00 or with larger contributions,\xa0we ask that you to take a look at some of the very kool perks we are able to offer!\xa0But if not, that is okay too! We just ask that you \'like\' our FB page and show support for this group of very talented, relentless and determined artists!\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \n\n\nHOW WE ARE ABLE TO SHOOT FOR SO LITTLE MONEY:\xa0Many have asked how we\xa0are even able to shoot our episode for such little money, especially considering named attachments. This was accomplished directly by\xa0not only the talents,\xa0crew and the directors ability to \'defer\' their pay (first episode only), but by a collective willingness by many of their agents and managers!STRETCH\xa0GOAL: If we reach $45,000 in this initial campaign, for each additional $30,000 Pledged (above our initial goal) will trigger the following exciting things:\xa01)\xa0We will\xa0produce an additional episode, 2)\xa0we will open additional rewards to appear\xa0in our series, 3)\xa0we will open additional Producer Credits, and 4) we will open additional on-screen credits!\n\n\nWe are ready to make this next big step, but we need your help to make it as big as we possibly can! Funds from Kickstarter will be used for:\nCast and crew. In addition to the familiar faces of Under The Radar, we will be casting talent from all across the country and recruiting some great people for behind the camera as well. \xa0The more money we raise, the bigger the project becomes and the more talent we can attract. That\'s just math.\nLocations, locations, locations. With more money we can add better locations for our shoot days and it\xa0will be used to help haul all those cast and crew to distant\xa0locales!\nFood,\xa0and other production essentials.\xa0\nPost production.\n\nDigital Badge\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficial UTR/SMP Mug (ONLY found here!)\n\n\nSMP Hat!\n\n\n\nSYNOPSIS: A brilliant, yet impossible-to-work-with Bounty Hunter (Kiyano La\'Vin) is forced to rely on his best friend and former partner when the attempted apprehension of a high-profile fugitive (Said Faraj) takes an unexpected turn.STARRING: Kiyano La\' Vin (FOX\'s Gang Related), John Wesley (Remember the Titans), Said Faraj (Green Zone) David \'Shark\' Fralick (The Young and The Restless), Victor Stagliano ( Showtime\'s Ray Donovan) and special guest, Cleo King (Mike & Molly)\xa0 EPISODE ONE: "The Mechanic"DIRECTOR: Frank Pinnock www.imdb.com/name/nm0684461/\xa0(Known for the crime drama\xa0Sangre Negra starring Erik Estrada\xa0and Eric Roberts)WRITER: Lawrence Buch\xe9rGENRE: Crime/Drama\xa0PRODUCERS: Kiyano La\'Vin, Lawrence Buch\xe9r\n\n\n\n\n\nCAST BIO (EACH PHOTO IS \'CLICKABLE\' WITH HYPERLINK)\n\nKiyano La\'Vin\n\n\nKIYANO LA\u2019VIN (Executive Producer)~ Kiyano, a seasoned actor of both stage and screen, nominated by the NAACP for his portrayal in the critically acclaimed play The Bachelorette Party starring Grammy Award-Winning Ginuwine, performing on shows such as CSI: NY, FRANKLIN AND BASH, SONS OF ANARCHY, FOX\u2019S, GANG RELATED and most recently credited for his role on the ABC TV Show, CASTLE, plays MILES BENTLEY: an early 40s do-what-it-takes Bounty Hunter who has always been known for closing the deal- until of recent.\n\nDavid \'Shark\' Fralick\n\nDAVID "SHARK" FRALICK~ Shark, having over 80 IMDb credits to his illustrious tv/film career, known for multiple studio-level performances which includes his eight-season performance as LARRY WARTON on THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS, plays, RUSTY CONNER: A mid 40\u2019s ex-cop who fell back on bounty hunting after being forced to retire from the LAPD due to a Pawn Shop scheme which he was implicated in.\n\nJohn Wesley\n\n JOHN WESLEY~ John,\xa0with over 100 TV and Film credits to his name, appearing in the most prominent movies and TV shows to date; MISSING IN ACTION 2-THE BEGINNING, KNIGHT RIDER, HILL STREET BLUES,\xa0 MARRIED WITH CHILDREN, IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT, JAG,\xa0 NIGHT STALKER,\xa0 MEDIUM,\xa0 and most recently credited for a riveting performance as Chester Lincoln in the crime film,\xa0 THE MIDNIGHTERS; plays DANIEL McMULLEN:\xa0a thirty-plus year seasoned West Coast Bail Agent who thought he has seen it all until having to deal with the recent botched job at the hands of Miles and his partner, Rusty Conner.\n\nCleo King\n\n CLEO KING~ Cleo, known for her four-season performance as GRANDMA on MIKE & MOLLY, THE HANGOVER, THE LIFE OF DAVID GALE, PINEAPPLE EXPRESS, and TRANSFORMERS: AGE OF EXTINCTION plays MS.

u"\nThe project and the about me really go hand in hand since I am the project. With the game of golf I have had more downs than ups with this game yet still cling to the possibility that I could play this game at the highest level. Right now with the cost of a good set of clubs being so high and working nights on an hourly wage it really doesn't cover the cost of being able to purchase them. This would be the first step on my road to becoming a Tour Professional. With the new set of clubs I would be able to start getting my golf game in order again. The reason I do not have clubs at the moment was that I was working at a golf course but with cost of living being so high all my money went to bills and food with one particularly bad month and unexpected bills I had to sell my golf clubs. My main goal is being able to acquire a sponsor to start playing the professional mini tours. These are also very expensive being you might need $40-50,0000 for year covering cost of living, play/practice time, traveling, coaching etc.... any money I receive over the cost of the equipment will go to pay for tournaments etc..\xa0 I am 33 years old, and have had a roller coaster of a time with golf in my life. I didn't get into the game till I was about 18. I got my handicap very low in my early 20s and did not play in college. I started playing the mini tours in Southern California when my then ex girlfriend decided to steal everything I own and leave me penniless. I decided to move out to AZ where my family was and start over, another time in my life where I had no golf clubs the game was forgotten for the next 7 years where I got into sales. What brought me back was when I went out and shot 71 first time on a golf course in almost a decade. I quit my sales job and got a job at a golf course. Playing and practicing I was able to get my game down to a +3 handicap and shooting mid 60s to low 70s consistently. The problem was that I had no money for tournaments and no contacts for a sponsor. Now here I am today, I gave up on golf over a year ago frustrated but it has never left my mind. I watch the television coverage every week dreaming I was there. This is pretty much one of my last shots at doing something. Thank you very much!\n"

u"\nHello, my name is Seth and I am asking for pledges to start up an Old School Type of Barber and Tattoo Shop here in Michigan!!! Don't you miss the feeling that you had going to get your haircut with your Dad/Grandfather and watching him get those amazing hot towel and straight shaves? Well I do and I would like to bring back that kind of vibe along with the good feeling of those old timers doing tattoos in three piece suits... while you wait for service you can be looking at are Art Gallery in the front of the shop that features all of our tattoo artist and different artists for around the state. I also want to have a place for real artists to come and work in a nice welcoming environment instead of all of these mean & nasty shops that undercut and rip people off. I want this place to be a place that you wouldn't mind bringing you family into. A down to earth Classy establishment. Aren't you tired of those disgusting shop popping up all over town and wondering if you might catch something from just walking in? SO AM I!\xa0I have been tattooing for just over 14 years now and have been painting for longer than that, so I know many artists off all kinds and from being in the business so long I know many Barbers as well that would love to come and work with me. I have a place that used to be a tattoo shop so the zoning is already done. All I'd have to do is get my Business name registered and call the health department into look at the place, and we'd be open for business in less than a month making a difference in the comunity all around us. I would also like to hold painting and art classes for the youth in the shop during the morning hours the expand their minds, too.So, If you'd like to be apart of something that changes people and their surroundings, jump on board and Pledge to help this Michigan town make some changes in the community.\n"

u'\nWhy can\u2019t photography training videos be more entertaining? Why are they all shot in a studio? I don\u2019t have a studio, do you?I can\u2019t relate, I shoot everything on location.\xa0\n\n\nA while back I joined up with Mark Behrens the founder of the Lighting Asylum and he began to teach me photography. I quickly met other photographers; it\u2019s not hard 1 out of every 4 friends on Facebook claims to be a photographer!\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\nWhat I noticed is that everyone had excuses for average work, \u201cI only shoot natural light\u201d, \u201cmy equipment is not good enough\u201d, or \u201cthe lighting is not good today\u201d\u2026\xa0\n\n\nWhat I found out is that most people calling themselves photographers just never had anyone really explain lighting to them before, at least in a way that made sense.\xa0\nWe have been shooting this tutorial for almost a year now, in between jobs, family commitments and has been 100% funded at this point out of our own pockets.\xa0\n\n\n\xa0This is where you come in, we need to master the video and have the physical copies printed and the cost of this will halt the release date for months as we save up these funds. This kickstarter will allow us to move this date up to November of this year!\xa0\nDo you have anything that you are really passionate about? You know \u2026something that you just cannot not stop thinking about; something that frequently wakes you up in the middle of the night?\xa0\nWell, Photography is that for me!\xa0\n\nLance Briggs, #55 Chicago Bears\n\nI\u2019ve found the answer! It seemed crazy at first. Why not take the mountain to Mohamed?\nHow could I do that? By taking everything that I have learned about flash and putting it all into a video. So crazy was the idea, that after almost 12 months of work putting it all together, it\u2019s almost here\u2026\xa0\nPlease help us cross the finish line!\xa0\nThank you,\n\xa0Corbin Maki and the Lighting Asylum team\n'
Current:
u'\nWhy does learning have to be so challenging, dry, and matter-of-fact?Why can\u2019t it be fun, enjoyable, and entertaining?.We asked ourselves these questions\u2014as they relate to photography, and specifically correct lighting in photography\u2014several years ago.  The answer was our original DVD, The Lighting Asylum.  We launched the program on Kickstarter where we were able to secure the funds necessary to create a professionally produced DVD.\xa0.\nThe Lighting Asylum was a rousing success, watched by thousands of photographers in over 40 countries!  Thank you to each and every one of you who purchased the DVD.\nBut it doesn\u2019t end there\u2026\n\n\n\nWith the success of The Lighting Asylum we have been introduced to many new methods and techniques which have served to enhance our original program, and have formed the basis for our newest video, \u201cUnderstanding Flash,\u201d a practical, and entertaining, tutorial on flash photography.\nThe new video features Corbin Maki, an attractive and talented young photographer who presents everything you need to know about flash photography!  \u2026Well, at least enough to start an addiction to artificial lighting.  \nYou will absolutely love the way Corbin presents all the elements of flash photography in an engaging, amusing, and enjoyable manner!\n\n\n\xa0As you can imagine, shooting, editing, and producing a professional quality DVD is very expensive.  To help complete our newest video, and make it available as soon as possible, we have launched a Kickstarter campaign.  As a photographer, your contribution to this campaign will ensure the video is completed in the next few months, which we know will benefit the entire photographic community.\nSo please join us in making this a rousing success.  Your contribution of any amount will guarantee the completion of the DVD \u2026and you will be eligible for a 30% discount as soon as the DVD is ready.Don\u2019t wait, help us complete the campaign and get this helpful and entertaining video \u201cin the can.\u201d   \n\n\nThank you for your valued support,\n\n\n\xa0Corbin Maki and the Lighting Asylum team\n\n'

u'\nThe game the funds are going towards is in the early stages of development still.\xa0It\'s a platformer, and side-scroller.Here is the story so far:\xa0A prince must rescue his "damsel" in distress from the clutches of evil!It\'s way more complicated than that, but until we are further in development, I can\'t really go further into detail, those who have funded us, will get the detailed story!\n'

u'\nThis game is being made by a two man group!Dominique Jackson and Robert Jackson.We have no previous public works that we can show you, I\'ve only made what I could in free game making programs and software because I didn\'t have the money too. Robert made an MMO in college and has made other mini games, but none were published.In spite of those flaws, I\'m hoping you can see the potential in this game, since we don\'t have any history, it\'s harder to get any funding or help. We are hoping by looking this post, you will understand what we are trying to accomplish!Team (will grow with more funding):Concept Art: Robert JacksonProgramming: Dominique JacksonModeler/Visual Design: Robert JacksonAudio: Dominique JacksonMarketing: Dominique JacksonOnce we get the funding we need, we can start getting the software we need to boost the overall quality of the game itself. Hopefully it will be enough to finish the game completely, but it\'s very hard for us to come up with the money to fund it ourselves, hoping we can find the right community through this website that shares our passion and will help make this game future clearer!It\'s a platformer, and side-scroller.Here\'s a full explanation so far:The main character of the video game is a prince, his mother and father are the rulers of the kingdom the game takes place in. He is also in love with this very beautiful girl, but she\'s in the lower class. He was given this miniature dragon as a pet from his father, your younger brother has one too, the dragons have the trait of absorbing elements around them and using that power as their weapon, they can also fuse with you and give you that elemental power. Your younger brother despises you, because you are to be heir to the throne. He decides to kill your parents and kidnap your love interest, and orders you to give him the throne or else he will kill her, the game is your journey to stop your brother and save your true love, with the help of your dragon sidekick.It has the classic side scrolling aspects to it, like Mario for example. But the graphics are going to look almost 3D but still having that 2D look, we haven\'t decided wether to give it a retro look or a "artsy" look too it.It will have a interesting sidekick feature, your pet dragon has the power to absorb the elements around you, which will differ depending on the level you are in. If you pick up a certain power up, your dragon will bond to you, giving you the elemental power it\'s absorbed and changing your physical form.There are a plethora of baddies too beat so don\'t worry about not having enough fun!\xa0Hopefully the concept art we will be releasing in the Update section will shed more light on the vision for this game.\n'

u"\nAbout the Artist \xa0 \xa0\xa0www.leightonautrey.com\nLeighton Autrey Art is based in the Dallas, Texas area and has shown art all across the world. He is mostly known for his Biblical artwork where he turns scriptures from the Holy Bible into modern contemporary works of art. He has shown all over the world including events such as Super Bowl XLV, the 2012 London Olympics and Miami Art Basel. He has done and continues to do many personal commission pieces for high profile clients and for companies like Red Bull.\xa0\nSCOPE\nAll throughout history the bible has been used as inspiration for artist to create countless works of art. Many of these biblical accounts have been addressed tirelessly throughout art history and today. Stories such as David and Goliath, Moses and the Red Sea, Noah's ark and many others. But how many times have you seen the same concept visually portrayed of each story? David standing over a dead Goliath. Moses holding his staff up as the waters are parted. Animals standing around on a boat with an old aged Noah. Though still a good reminder of the stories, we have become numb to these images because we have seen them so many times.In today's contemporary world we are being bombarded with images every second we are awake. Cell phones, tablets, computers, television, and billboards are all fighting for attention. Getting someones attention is hard. That is what Visceral Victories is all about. Instead of portraying David standing over Goliath, how about a huge six and half foot cracked skull with a huge hole in it where David's stone sank in Goliath's head? Horses drowning and gasping for air from when the waters of the Red Sea collapsed on top of them might get you thinking about Moses in a different way. That's what all 20 plus pieces of Visceral Victories\xa0is for, seeing biblical art in a different way and giving people hope through art.VISCERAL VICTORIES: ARTIST STATEMENTDESIGN\nEach piece is taken directly out of a\xa0scripture\xa0in the Holy\xa0Bible.\nEach piece is\xa0portrayed\xa0artistically in a bold new manner.\nEach piece was constructed from raw materials such as wood, canvas and many others.\nEach piece was hand built by the artist.\nEach piece has a video that briefly describes the piece\xa0artistically\xa0and\xa0biblically.\nEach piece flows with the theme of the show.\nCOST BREAKDOWNThe minimum I have set here is for the expenses to run the show a whole month in Dallas. After the cost of printing and shipping all the packages, the money left over will be used for following:\nWarehouse Fees\nLights and lighting\nGenerator rentals\nGasoline and diesel for generators\nInsurance\nSecurity\nBathrooms\nAny amounts above the minimum will be to take the show to a different city for a few weeks for a year. \xa0Houston, Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and many other cities would make great hosts for this project. So share this project to the world and let your city know about it!REWARDS\n\nVisceral Victories Black Baseball Tee\n\n\n\nEach paper print will incorporate the accompanying small QR code that will be visible on bottom of the print.\xa0Anyone with a smartphone will be able to scan the QR code that will take them directly to a brief video about the piece.\n\nClick on image to watch video about the piece.\n\n\nClick on the image to watch video about this piece.\n\n\nClick on the image to watch video about this piece.\n\n\nClick on the image to watch video about this piece.\n\n\nClick on image to watch video about this piece.\n\n\nClick on the image to watch video about this piece.\n\n\n\nClick on the image to watch video about this piece.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\nClick on the image to watch video about this piece.\n\n\nClick on the image to watch video about this piece.\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

u"\nOur farm won't just be your average farm. We want to combine a variety of growing methods to create a model farm for our future food production. We want to show how we can grow 100% organic and pesticide free. We will combine aquaponics and vermiponics in a greenhouse environment. Using these methods you can get your plants to grow up to 10 times faster than normal growing methods. Aquaponics is the use of fish by cycling their water that is filled with nutrient to the plants. The plants uptake the nutrient and pH balance and clean the water for the fish. Vermiponics is the use of worms to create a living growing medium for your plants. The warms produce warms castings which can be another good product to sell. I want to start on a smaller scale right now since I am limited on space and still new to this method. We don't want to go to big to fast and set ourselves up for failure. We want to learn as much as a we can before we buy land and grow to a lot larger scale. We managed to build greenhouse this summer and that going. This is where we need the funds to finish the greenhouse and the business plan. We have also found a few grants in this area. As soon as the business plan is complete, We will be applying for them. We will also be converting it all to renewable energy which will be a combination of solar, wind turbine, and if we find land with enough water we would like to put a small hydro turbine in. But all of that still needs more research to make sure it will be worth it and done right. Once we have everything up an running to certain point we want to have charity music festivals or events to educate the community on everything about the farm and better farming methods. We feel there are so many avenues we can take this down once we get started we won't stop. I work at a job I would trade in a heart beat to have this. We have our first child on the way so we have that motivation behind us to achieve our goal. Hopefully we can help build a better future for our new family and at the same time how we farm as a society.\xa0\n"
Current:
u"\nOur ultimate goal is to own a farm where we utilize the growing method called Aquaponics. Its a combination of fish and plants working together. The fish water gets cycled through the plants as food. The plants clean and PH balance the water that gets sent back to the fish. You can grow a huge variety of fruits, greens, and vegetables with this method. It's super clean and very efficient and 100% organic. It will be in a greenhouse so the environment is completely controlled and easy to keep bug free. I've already got the greenhouse built this summer and now I would like to add on to it. With winter coming I would like to add a small solar setup so I can hang lights. This will also make it so I can grow year round. I would also like to have the fish part of it setup and going for this next spring. Right now some of the things I am growing is Kale, Peppers, Tomatoes, and Squash. My goal for next spring is to be growing enough to sell at the farmers market every weekend. From there just keep expanding as I can. \xa0Once I am in a position to buy land and do it on a commercial scale. I want to show how with the use of solar power and depending on the land if it has a well. This method is very resource efficient. I want to offer classes on how to do it and how important this method is for our future of agriculture. \xa0\n"

u'\nSince the dawn of human thought, we have pondered our existence, the power of faith, our ability to follow ideas and make them reality. All religions teach of the power of the mind, the consciousness itself, and reasons to keep it clear and focused. I have met people who have experienced "supernatural" events, and have been medicated, even locked up, and forced to believe that they were ill. There are so many reasons to want to understand this concept, (the afterlife), and whether or not it is true, that I honestly can\'t think of a reason why it\'s not important. People repeat negative patterns, until something like almost dying sparks a change in their motivation. People have killed themselves because of lost loves, or deaths in their families. People sit around waiting for things to change, or things to make sense, and yet everything we are taught teaches us to be patient and vigilant. Being patient is not the same as barely surviving until we get what we want, or get where we need to be. If we all have our own fates, our own guidance, that transcends the current model of thought, then why deny ourselves that relationship? How many people could be cured of depression, deep seated hate, abuse of any sort, if they could dig deeper? This is why I seek, for my own validation, for my own inner strength, and if it helps me find understanding, why wouldn\'t it work for you, or at least help you become aware of another potential? In order to proceed with the life between life regression process, a list of 10 people who have played important roles in your life must be made. My life, admittedly has been a bit crazy. My father died when I was 2. My brothers and I were taken into the foster care system at a young age. The reason I can confidently offer around 40 hours of footage is due to the fact that the list of "characters" or "cast", of my life will be explained as thoroughly as possible, and both of our LBLs alone will be around 10 hours. Before I actually do the regression, you will understand parental relationships, including my dead father, a few of my friends that I have met in strange parts of my life, and even a few VERY surprising influences. If this is real, (our ability to consciously tap into the very fabric of fate), then it would be assumingly true that everything I have experienced thus far, would have all been preconceived, in the very least as a potential aspect of my life\'s path. It would be easy for me to have done the research before hand, and simply assure you that my experience is real..... but I think this is a more efficient way for you to make an accurate assumption. Whatever truth that may present itself will\xa0 be revealed to you, as it is to me, (with the possible alteration of names, for the sake of privacy and respect). No smoke, no mirrors, no illusions. (There will probably be literal smoke, and possibly literal mirrors, but...... you know what I mean.) I will not act for the camera. I will be myself, and share my story, the good, the bad, and the unbelievably true. \n'
Current:
u"\nThis probably doesn't mean anything to you, but there are people who have actual experiences with God. From what I have seen in my life, it can be absolutely horrifying to experience things and question their reality due to lack of belief. Your emotions can easily run away with you, and you can find yourself addicted to fear. Addicted to anger. Addicted to lust. Addicted to greed. Addicted to escaping reality.\xa0\xa0 There is a reason these things are all lumped together and called sin. Their very presence in our life can lead to things that affect us all in bad ways. Not just if you or I do them, but if anyone falls into this category. Our world is interactive. A mere thought in my head can enter your mind, as it is now. If I walked past you in a store, you are forced to deal with the fact that I exist. I exist whether or not you see me.\xa0\xa0\xa0 But there are clues to my existence. The fact that you can read these words is proof of my existence. That being said, I am on a personal journey. One that has not only given me proof of God's existence, logically, emotionally, and visually, but I have stumbled upon a way to possibly communicate at will. \xa0\xa0 Yes, it is through hypnosis. But what is hypnosis? Imagine the combination of these emotions. Relaxed. Clear minded. With faith on a direction, or ultimate purpose. Reaching into the very reason that you, personally, exist. I can tell you that I could do this cheaper, but I'm not sure how much taxes will be for even trying to do this. I can explain that you don't need to watch the 40 hour version, which would include around 9 hours of the hypnosis session in and of itself. But doing it this way will keep me from my family for many hours a day, for quite a few months.\xa0\xa0 You could just watch this as a typical movie, a documentary, devoid of any true comprehension of what it all means. I will explain that since I am 31 years old, and that I have lived many lives, even in this body, that I have a lot to say. And much subtext will be lost in a typical movie format. \xa0 My life story includes suicide attempts, foster care, placement, the military, the psych ward, Juggalos, angels, demons, spirit guides, a deceased father, an animal totem, prophetic dreams, marriage, Jesus and God, and so much more. \xa0 In order to begin the life between life process, I must come up with a list of the 10 most influential people in my life. And if you read my previous list, these would be clues to those influences.\xa0\xa0 I can't pretend to know if you ever dealt with the effects of losing a loved one, or\xa0 lost someone that you knew to be a soul mate. I can only hope that you have never had terrifying experiences that scarred your mind. I only pray that you never dealt with abuse, depression, or wanting to die, but I believe that doing this documentary will clear those issues from my life.\xa0\xa0 My goal is this.... I need to do this. If you don't care about it's implications, at least share it, there may be people you know that do.\n"

u"\n\n\n\xa0About We Act!\nDIFFERbilities Experience\u2019s We Act is an innovative program that allows people with and without disabilities to come together to act. Our hope is that through such a program students will be able to act together and engage in an environment that is inclusive, accepting and respectful. We Act is in its first year and will be piloted at Anoka High School. \nBy supporting We Act, you are not supporting just a theater program, you are supporting a revolution!\nThe Structure of We Act\nWe Act has an unique structure that makes it accessible to various ability levels. Rather than a traditional play, where actors have to memorize positions, gestures and lines. We Act Actors will play a series of games that allows the actors to act out their piece in their own way that is comfortable to them. These games are structured and are easily replicated in the sharing piece. This is unique because each actor is able adapt it to his/hers own needs. Through a combination of several games, students produce a sharing piece that has a plot and story line similar to a traditional play.\nWhy this method you ask? We Act is all about creating acceptance and inclusion and this means if someone cannot memorize lines or be fully mobile on set they can still participate in a meaningful way. Don\u2019t worry, this method of using series of games to create a sharing piece has been a highly successful method used by CLIMB Theater, a touring education theater in the Upper Midwest.\nGoals of We Act\n\xa01.\tParticipants would not have otherwise participated in the arts have access to theatre\xa02.\tParticipants show growth in their theatrical abilities and participate in a public sharing piece\xa03.\tParticipating in theater with people who have different abilities allow participants to have increased understanding and deeper relationships with those who are different from them\xa0History of DIFFERbilities Experience\xa0Danielle Liebl, Founder of DIFFERbilities Experience, is an expert in the field of working with those with intellectual and developmental disabilities.  Her experience with the population started at a young age. Danielle was born with cerebral palsy and was told by several doctors that she would never succeed in school or live independently. In addition, her peers relentlessly bullied her and teachers told her that she was \u201ctoo dumb to understand.\u201d But Danielle refused to live her life limited by the low expectations of experts.\xa0Impassioned by her personal successes, Danielle decided to organize a school club, Students for the Advancement of People with DIFFERbilities (now DIFFERbilities Experience,Inc) that aims to reduce the stigmas associated with disabilities by connecting young people with and without disabilities. Today, DIFFERbilities Experience, Inc. is a 501(c)3 organization that provides friendship and inclusion building opportunities to high school and college students both with and without disabilities in a controlled environment.\xa0With a focus on each individual's differing abilities and interests in art, education, and sports, students foster communities of inclusion, acceptance and mutual respect.\xa0\xa0Through DIFFERbilities Experience, students have helped to build friendships and develop understanding among students from different backgrounds, which Liebl says is the most important part the organization, because it has designed a powerful model of controlled exposure by partnering students with and without intellectual disabilities. As one student said: \u201c(People with intellectual disabilities) are my friend, they have impacted my life in one war or another.\u201d\n\xa0***Please note that all funds will be used for the sole purpose of We Act at Anoka High School***\n\n\n"

u"\nOur story so far...Founded in 2013 in Edinburgh, Scotland (not exactly the surf capital of the world right?), Ash Boddy - Aussie Corrective Exercise Specialist - got a laptop, plugged in his creativity, and came up with the Weekend Surf Warrior.The Weekend Surf Warrior provides corrective exercise programmes (via interactive PDF documents) to landlocked & injured surfers who, like Ash, are desperate to get in the water whenever they can, and make the most out of their precious surfing time.Since January 2013, the Weekend Surf Warrior has been a massive experiment: providing a dedicated community of surfers all over the world with a programme to help them maximise their time in the water.Our primary way of marketing ourselves is an oxymoron: we provide free information about surf fitness, technique, injury rehab & health.Why do we provide free information? Because we want to:a) be helpfulb) be a trustworthy sourceWHERE WE ARE NOW:We have sold programmes in more than 15 countries to surfers in pain, in the middle of cities & infrequent surfers.But more importantly, we've grown an active community & following who benefit from our free information series:\nover 1,000 Facebook fans\nover 450 weekly email subscribers\n350 YouTube subscribers\nWe get regular requests for more blogs and information ranging from post-surf cool downs, knee pain and daily architecture advice.WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP: \nWe really value the feedback of surfers and we want to be better at what we do.And the one piece of feedback we get on a regular basis is about the quality of our videos.We film everything on iPhones so the sounds & visual quality isn't great.We need to get better audio/visual equipment so that we can provide better quality information to people like you: people who are passionate about surfing & want high quality information to help make you a better surfer.WHAT WE'LL DO WITH THE PROJECTWe will purchase some higher quality equipment so that we can do the following:\nfilm more informational videos, especially on technique in the water.\nre-shoot some of the key informational blogs so that they are clearer & more helpful.\nupgrade all the images & videos on our programmes so that they are more precise & fool-proof!\n"

u"\n\nTweet about the Dickstarter!\n\nhttps://twitter.com/TheDickstarterWHAT?I just graduated college and I have no job. Let's bring it back to the goals of my youth. I want to make the world's biggest dick drawing. With your help, I will be able to create a wonderful (and long) drawing of the male anatomy. This is both a personal project rooted in my childhood dreams, as well as a collaborate project to spread awareness and understanding of our bodies. We didn't grow up drawing dicks out of nowhere. It was fun, it was funny. It's still fun and it's still funny. Whether it is a terrible sketch on a bar napkin or a beautiful painting on a canvas; a dick drawing is a dick drawing. Seeing an abstract dick by Picasso in a museum is just as funny as drawing one for yourself in the condensation of a car window. Let's impress Guinness with the World's Biggest Dick Drawing. Project WBDD is officially on the rise!HOW?The pledges for this art project will directly dictate the outcome of the dick drawing. Every dollar will add an inch to the drawing. The inches will be accumulated and drawn on high quality paper, then the paper will be spread out to form the dick drawing. This forming of the dick drawing will most likely take place outside wherever a large surface area is available. The goal is set at 100 inches (which would probably be a record breaking dick drawing) but I will draw this thing as many inches as the pledges expect me to. Every pledge will have their name attributed to their inch and all pledges will be listed in a huge thank you letter. Let's see who is willing to make this drawing erect to massive proportions!WHY?It's everyone's dream to see a huge dick drawing. For scientific purposes or otherwise.ANYTHING ELSE?Once funding is complete the entire dick drawing project will be documented and hopefully DVDs can be made to thank everyone on video, and so you and your kids can someday watch the history you helped make!If the dick drawing is successful enough, we can probably get some sort of recognition from Guinness (hopefully a plaque with a dick engraving).***INCENTIVES*** Dickstarter Promo Shirt: *Adds five inches to drawing* (only five available)\n\n\nDickstarter Private's Shirt: *Adds five inches to drawing* (only thirty available)\n\n\nDickstarter General's Shirt: *Adds ten inches to drawing* (only thirty available)\n\n\nSEND IN YOUR OWN DICK DRAWINGS!I'm accepting everyone's own personal dick drawings (for another project in the future or after the Dickstarter has ended) and would love if you submitted yours!

u'\nThis concept has been in the works for about three years. I build koi ponds and water gardens and had difficulty with filtration. I developed this system using an old washing machine, and have had incredible results. Safe, easy to use, completes the nitrogen cycle, grows beneficial bacteria, and it take about 3 minutes to run a cleaning cycle...the user never touches any dirty pads. Waste water is minimal and is used as fertilizer out to the garden. Fish farming, cattle watering, and even humanitarian purposes where water needs to be cleaned. This is a beautiful idea using\xa0 proven technology and durable machinery. I have a patent pending as well.I would like to further develop this machine to make it automated, and have it be in a long-lasting plastic housing so that it will make it more functional and aesthetically pleasing. Thank you.\n'

u'\nFor the past three years I have concentrated my time on improving a more enhanced filtration systemfor\xa0koi ponds, and water gardens. Other current systems prove to be time consuming, complicated, and inefficient.\nThis system is safe and simple to operate, and completes the nitrogen cycle by providing the proper conditions to grow beneficial bacteria.

u"\nThe Origins Of WonderlandOver four years ago I set out to define this generation's Alice. The story you are all familiar with is almost 150 years old, where women were viewed a lot differently than they are now.That story took place in a fictional fantasy world with some basis in reality. \xa0\xa0Alice to me has always been an interesting character but she has never evolved as society has evolved. \xa0Even Romeo and Juliet has been modernized and retold from many different points of views. \xa0\xa0I saw this as a chance to tell a compelling, but different take on Alice in Wonderland. \xa0During those four years I read the Adventures in Wonderland books a multitude of times, only to discover how rich the characters and stories really are. I learned that these characters didn\u2019t need a fantasy world to exist, they could exist at any time in history and could have multiple incarnations throughout history. My vision of Wonderland was born! The next thing I wanted was my Wonderland to be grounded and real so I researched history to see if I could build a complex but amazing story that had a real feel to it. I went back as far as the 1400\u2019s in England (the birthplace of Alice but not until 1865), and found that every 200 years there were some big events in history that support a compelling back story to the events that take place in the first movie of my trilogy. \xa0Alice + University = Horror/Thriller FilmTo create a real Wonderland, I had to find a reason why Alice would even go to Wonderland. My answer was simple because the town has a College University. \xa0With Alice being a college student that allowed me to evolve her character to this generation.The University of Wonderland was created to support not only the film, but to give fans (like myself) a way to connect to the story in an very organic way. \xa0So with the launch of Kickstarter, not only can you get University SWAG for your donation levels, but you can also register to be a student at the University of Wonderland. So don\u2019t delay, keep updated on your University pride and events by registering here athttp://universityofwonderland.com/registration.html . \xa0\n\n\nFollow us on Instagram/Facebook/Twitter/TumblrA University means College SWAGCreating Wonderland University, gave us a chance to give you some really amazing rewards that you can wear with pride and support your school mascot the Jabberwockys,or Jabbers for short.From t-shirts, hats, sweatshirts, and posters this is just a small sample of the things that are to come in the next year. I wanted people to love the W.U. swag that they are getting. I mean supporting a film you want to see is great, but I want to give something back and build a community of Wonderlander's. Just a couple examples of what we have for you. Did You Say Horror/Thriller Film?Why of course I did, who wouldn\u2019t put Alice in a horror film? \xa0I might have grounded Wonderland in history but as we all know the sins of our past come back to haunt us. Since there is over 600 years of history with these films, there is bound to be things in people's past that they might not be proud of. In this story there is a lot of bad blood. I had to test my Alice to make her become the hero of Canton (alright I had to throw that in there for all my fellow Browncoats). So being that I\u2019m a huge fan of Joss Whedon (couldn\u2019t have guessed) and Quentin Tarantino I put in motion to create a horror/thriller movie that took the best of both directors and combined them into this hybrid horror/thriller. We will rely on special effects makeup to achieve that 80\u2019s horror films we grew up watching.Alice Has A Samurai Sword?You are correct and that was by design, the story of her sword is supported by some historical events and has been part of her bloodline for over 400 years. \xa0It has an amazing name, and even the sword itself has a story to tell as it traveled from Japan to England to America. I can't wait to share those comics with you fans as our story progresses including Alice's Swords name which I won't share with you just yet.... \xa0In the mean time you can donate at $200 to get this exclusive poster in English or Japanese beautiful artwork done by an amazing artist.\n\n$200 Reward Level Exclusive Poster Japanese or English Version\n\nSisters: Story of Loss and Love In WonderlandWonderland: Retribution is just the first of the three films that tell the story of the sisters adventures in Wonderland.This past year Disney proved (although they didn\u2019t market it that way at first), that there is an audience for sister driven films.That proved that my adaption of a sister's story but in the horror genre could take off because eventually those young fans grow up. During the writing process, I discovered that one of the biggest factors in wanting to tell the sister\u2019s story come from the cult film Night of the Comet which happens to be about a pair of sister\u2019s from California as they deal with half living comet created zombies (if you have a chance to check it out please do). \xa0I already have the ending for the third film, and two rough outlines for the second and third film. \xa0Connecting with CharactersMost films don\u2019t have the time to build really great characters, but the movies that do have a profound impact on the reaction of the fans. \xa0Especially in the horror genre where characters are just created to be murdered in some sort of a way. \xa0\xa0As I love that aspect of that genre this is where my film will be different, I have put a lot of complexity into these characters, their motives and reason for survival or death are all very impactful in the world I\u2019ve created. \xa0The reason I choose to do that type of depth to my characters is because I already have 150 years of character development behind them as they are defined loosely on the characters you have come to love and know in Alice Adventures in Wonderland. Part of this process is having my cast go out and promote the film, not just to connect with the characters on screen but off the screen as well.\n\n\nThe Modern Alice The Hero You Have Asked ForThese past four years have been incredible creating Alice, a real Wonderland and a strong story supporting by a cast made up by a diverse range of actors. With a female portion that would not only be strong but also dictate the story from their point of view. \xa0In the past month every week you can find 2-3 articles supporting the need for a female hero (in most cases a superhero because of Marvel\u2019s success) and don\u2019t get me wrong I love marvel films. So I ask you the question, does she have to be SUPER to be a HERO? \xa0The answer is simple and we all know it and now you the FANS have a chance to show the industry there can be a real female HERO and strong women can carry a film in this genre. Here is your chance to choose your hero\u2019s, and characters that you want to see redefined into this generation. So Wonderlanders, I challenge you to fund our film and you will see Alice, Cheshire Cat, The Queen of Hearts, The White Queen, Dinah, The Red Queen, The White Rabbit, March Hare, and the Mad Hatter evolve into this generation. We need you to be the HERO we are looking for, to back our vision to tell this amazing and detailed story.Throughout the journey we will keep you updated, have amazing events and things that will incorporate you,the fans. What you see on the rewards is just a small example of the things we want to give to our backers through this journey because we can\u2019t do it without you. \xa0FILMING MAY-JULY 2015Once we are funded we will start filming around May 2015 and hope to have a movie to show next October (just in time for Alice In Wonderlands 150th Anniversary). This gives us time to do post production, hire the rest of the crew and cast and find our locations. Every bit of this you will be part of the whole way, from casting videos, to table reads, casting calls, we will share with you this process. There will be times I\u2019ll have a google hangout and just talk to you the fans and based on this schedule I wouldn\u2019t rule out a San Diego Comic Con appearance (in town at least) for our backers. \xa0\n"

u"\nABOUT THE FILM Wonderland:\xa0Retribution, the first movie in Jeremy Lipsey\u2019s multifilm horror saga, is a modern day adaptation of Lewis\xa0Carroll\u2019s \u201cAlice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland\u201d set in a New England college town with a dark, mysterious\xa0and murderous history.Until Lipsey\u2019s \u201cWonderland: Retribution,\u201d no other film adaptation of Lewis Carroll\u2019s most famous\xa0work has ever contemporized the story, nor modernized its heroine as a dynamic, capable and fiercely\xa0intelligent young woman.\n\n\nCHANGING THE CONVERSATION ABOUT HORROR FILM HEROINESEschewing the kind of movie whose heroine runs around half-clothed and screaming before being\xa0eviscerated, Jeremy Lipsey\u2019s Wonderland: Retribution is a thoughtful psychological horror film that\xa0speaks directly to contemporary female experiences.At a time when only 15% of protagonists, 29% of major characters and 30% of all speaking characters\xa0were female in last year's top 100 grossing films, Lipsey\u2019s female-driven, horror film franchise,\xa0Wonderland, presents a smart, original and provocative advance in a genre traditionally associated with\xa0the violent and sexualized objectification of women.The central character of Lipsey\u2019s Wonderland: Retribution is a fierce, samurai sword-swinging young\xa0woman firmly in charge of her own destiny.\n\n\nABOUT THE FILMMAKER \u201cToday\u2019s horror films are\xa0wildly popular with female audiences of all ages, but ironically no one is making horror movies that\xa0feature strong, confident women,\u201d states Wonderland: Retribution writer and director Jeremy Lipsey.\u201cI\u2019m a married father of two daughters. Creating a female character that is fiercely protective of loved\xa0ones, resilient in the face of terror, and resourceful in her ability to survive, more closely resembles the\xa0women I know and love in my life. With Wonderland: Retribution, we\u2019re creating a female-driven film\xa0that has legs and intelligence, and will still raise the hair on the back of your neck!\u201dFilmmaker Jeremy Lipsey was producer and assistant director of the documentary, Taylor\u2019s Gift. The\xa0film follows the parents of a thirteen-year old girl who died in a Colorado ski accident as they meet the\xa0recipients of their daughter\u2019s organ donations, including a married woman with two children and a\xa0failing heart, who live on because their daughter\u2019s gift. The documentary inspired a non-fiction book,\xa0as well as the creation of non-profit foundation promoting organ donation awareness. Segments from\xa0Lipsey\u2019s film appeared on ABC\u2019s Good Morning, America and NBC\u2019s The Today Show, and the story was\xa0featured on television news programs across the continent.Jeremy Lipsey began his entertainment career as a producer, videographer and photographer with the\xa0National Football League\u2019s Dallas Cowboys organization. While with the Cowboys, Jeremy produced\xa0television programming for the NFL Network, in addition to live streaming video and radio programs.\xa0An early innovator in digital and social media, Lipsey launched the team\u2019s first Facebook, Twitter and\xa0iPhone app initiatives, and earlier developed the international web brand of the Professional Bull Riders\xa0sports association. After Jeremy created the Professional Bull Riders branded YouTube channel, one\xa0of his early videos, \u201cKnocked Out\u201d reached 1.7 million views. Another video Jeremy produced for the\xa0Professional Bull Riders YouTube channel to date has reached over 12 million views.MAKE NIGHTMARES COME TRUE You don\u2019t need to be a Hollywood accountant to know that making movies is an expensive proposition.\xa0While Wonderland: Retribution, slated for shooting in summer, 2015, is not conceived to be a bank\xa0breaking studio project.

u"\nThe main idea of this project is to help young artists and designers become recognized for their great talents and works. In order to help these young artists and designers, I plan to construct an art gallery in Central Los Angeles and give artist and designer a chance to showcase their work. Art spaces will be provided for artists and designers to display their works. The gallery will be an open exhibition to the public. This will be an on going project awarding more new artists and designers the opportunity to shine. There will be music, drinks, snacks, and a small gift for people to enjoy the environment. Your contribution will help these starving artists by giving a hand to the gallery's rental space, utilities, art supplies, and construction. \nAs a young artist myself, I understand the great struggles of many artists and designers, making art their passion and dream. Since I don\u2019t have much finance to start this big project, your contribution would be a tremendous help for this project and I.\xa0\n"
